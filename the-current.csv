4,Supermarkets shouldn't be selling ANY fish. People are so worried about saving the oceans by not using straws and plastic but hey here's an idea - JUST STOP EATING FISH!,tp002
0,"Overfishing is a huge problem worldwide, and consumers barely know how much it impacts our oceans. Millions of marine wildlife, including dolphins, turtles, and various endangered species, are caught in fishing nets and killed with no regard whatsoever. I have seen photos of boats that have gone out fishing for ""squid"" and what they have caught is anything but. So much of this problem is caused by the demand from supermarkets and commercial businesses. If supermarkets refused to sell anything but sustainably caught fish, this would help alleviate the issues of overfishing, and see the fishing industry implement sustainable practices.",tp002

Many like him only catch what they can reasonably use and would like to pass on this activity to the next generation.

If big worldwide fishing companies CARED and DID fish sustaibably then yes. Supermarkets should buy sustaibably caught fish.,tp002

3,mwhile i think this is a good idea; there are still alot of people who struggle to afford food. if the prices go up on fish it could mean less people buy it. This could have knock on effects such as less demand on the fishing industry - thus loss of jobs- as a result putting more people into poverty. Overall i think there should be more sustainable products available than unsustainable -but not remove the cheaper options completely.,tp002

We need to change to a zero carbon economy and the sooner we do it the better. An individual person doesn't have much control over this sort of thing; businesses obviously want to make money; so by having legislation like this, everyone is pushed along in the right direction. It is great to see the proliferation of hybrid cars these days, and the emergence of really practical electric cars. Bring it on!",tp001

I'm not sure if the language of ""banned"" is a great one, as that limits each person's freedom of choice, but I would definitely agree that electric cars should be encouraged, as well as other transport alternatives. Having more frequent, reliable public transport that is more cost effective than taking a care is definitely a step in the right direction to reduce individual's car use. Having owned a hybrid car, I can definitely emphasise the cost-effectiveness of not having to fill up on petrol as often, especially with rising petrol prices. There are lots of ways to approach this, and I think any way to reduce transport emissions is the right way to go.",tp001

4,i think no,tp001

1,i think nz needs to declare cliate chabge as an emergency. to lead by exampleand use or resurces in a responsible way,tp001
0,I think over the last 150 years we have taken our planet and its longevity for granted. We are slowly realising our way of living is not sustainable. I hope we can make impactful changes quickly enough.,tp001
0,I think petrol cars are a horrific waste of resources and we should have moved on to sustainable fuel sources by now.,tp001

3,I think some people wont care and I think we need cars. Hopefully people buy electric cars so that we can get no petrol. But we see all theese save money on petrol adds? some people rely on cas that have petrol.,tp001
0,I think technology exists for cleaner cars that are just as effective as gas burners. If we can replace petrol-powered cars with a cleaner alternative we should.,tp001
0,I THINK TESLAS R SICK,tp001
1,I think that any effort made to reduce fossil fuels is an important change required to sustain the earth for future generations. Protecting the earth and our environment is of paramount importance regardless of the financial burden or the inconvenience or peoples opposition to change. Its not a question about SHOULD petrol cars be banned. Instead it should be asked WHEN will someone in power have the BALLS to impliment the change. And the answer to that question should be yesterday.,tp001
0,I think that by reducing our carbn footprint we can fix our ozone hole which will have a positive effect onour tourism industry. this will boost our economy thusly as we dont xport cars in the first place,tp001
0,i think that cars should be banned because of global warming and people say that in 12 years earth will not be able to be inhabited.,tp001
0,I think that cars should definitly be heading towards electricity at a much faster rate,tp001
0,i think that even though electric cars are less owerful theyare also more economical and have more torqe,tp001
3,I think that EVs are too expensive and that if we ban petrol cars it would be damaging to cmmunities in rural areas.,tp001
1,i think that fossil fuels are the past,tp001
1,i think that having better transport options is necessary but also hard to implement,tp001
0,i think that i will live for long!,tp001
1,i think that if this works climate change would be hindered-  maybe enough to buy us time to stop climate change altogether,tp001
0,I think that if we ban petrol cars then there will be less pollution in the world and we might have more of a healthier future,tp001
1,i think that it could  be good but also how would we get around,tp001
0,i think that it is a great idea to reduce our wrolds pollution by getting rid of petrol and having electric cars instead,tp001
0,i think that it is very important that we do something about climate change as it is a enourmous threattohumanity andwe cannot keep ignoring it. we have eleven years until climate change becomes irreversible.,tp001

1,i think that it would be good for the enviroment hehe and its good to try new things hehe,tp001
0,I think that its a really good idea because we don't need petrol cars becuse we've gt eletric cars and bikes,tp001
4,i think that its stupid beause about 3 million cars will be deemed useless. so where will they go? probably into millions of acres of land.,tp001
1,i think that itwill be better for animals and their water  because it will no longer be poluted,tp001
3,i think that not only me but everyone wants this car to leave,tp001
0,i think that people will look back on the age of petrol and think we were crazy to use it for so long,tp001
1,i think that petrol cars are obiously going to have an impacton out future,tp001
4,I think that petrol cars do so much damage to the environment that by 2030 there wont be much point changing what has already been done,tp001
1,I think that petrol cars might be banned but electric cars might become less common.,tp001
1,i think that petrol cars should be banned  sooner than that,tp001
1,i think that petrol cars should be banned because they are reckigthe envouriment and if we d not do something nw we manever be abe to do it again,tp001
1,I think that petrol cars should be banned because they are ruining the environment and polluting my future ( I am a child ),tp001
1,i think that petrol is bad . for  the enviromentand hurt nature,tp001
0,i think that petrol should be banned becase carbon emmisions are destroying the ozine layer,tp001
0,i think that that there is no point putting on that rule because some people like m like old cars so it should not be put n,tp001
0,I think that the only way to avoid climate catastrphe is to turn to a low carbon economy.,tp001
0,i think that the wholeworld should switch to renewabe energy,tp001
0,I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE BANNED EARLYIER BECAUSE OTHERHWISE THE WORLD WILL BE PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN!,tp001
1,I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE BANNED TO HELP STOP CLIMATE CHANGE AND AIR POLLUTION,tp001
0,i think that they should really be banned because they kind of kill the animals.,tp001
0,i think that this is a great idea,tp001
1,i think that this is a possibiity in first world countries as not everwhere has access to reliable and sustainable electricity,tp001
0,i think that this is a very good idea,tp001
1,I think that this might be a good idea. We should also be using electric cars. But I don't want this cycle to repeat because we are using too much electricity. But for now this is a good idea,tp001
1,i think that thy should be banned as it is bad forthe neviroment,tp001
1,i think that to make a change we need drastic action,tp001
4,I think that we should act fast,tp001
0,i think that we should be able to breath clean fesh air in our own city and not haveo worry about how clean the air is how how its effecting us as humns our lungs and the generations to come. electrc cars will help eliminate and or lessen this problem,tp001
1,i think that we should stop because it ill hopefully stop global warming in the long run.,tp001
1,i think that withot cars it would be alot easyer,tp001
1,i think thatit is an awsome idear but it is not coming along fast anuf we need to do more about plution,tp001
1,I think thatit wouldbe good for the environment and that people don't help enough.,tp001
3,i think thatmost people couldnt afford this fancy cars that you charge,tp001
2,i think thats not helpful,tp001
0,i think thatthey should be banned becauseit is polluting our earthand eventually us as well. (i am a child),tp001
0,i think thatwe need toput the planet first,tp001
0,i think the date should be earlier. look at the example of NORWAY. NZshould take more positive action.,tp001
1,i think the solution should be to provide better public transport etc instead of banning giving people alternitives.,tp001
0,"I think the use of ""banned: here is too forceful. That's not the country we live in. But petrol cars should be phased out and I think the government needs to support this financially. So many vehicles chug out pollution. I don't think 2030 is realistic for that kind of change. 2050 maybe. These things take a generation. Look at smoking today - are young people really doing it? Not nearly as much as when I was a teenager 20 years ago.",tp001
2,i think the whole world has to come together to make a difference and that is very unlikely. The war display of 70 years ago is an example of not learning we arestill fighting.,tp001
4,i think the world is dying,tp001
1,i think there is enough solution to use something else than the petrol but it is a big buisnes and the gouvernment earn so much money. but if thepeople really care about the planet they have to do something and i think in new zeland that possible but not everywhere,tp001
1,i think there is no need with proper public transport for there to beone person  and onecar,tp001
1,i think there needs to be suitable technology to allow the move toelectric ornon_petrol vehicles,tp001
0,i think there will be less pollution,tp001
1,I think there will be more opportunities to avoid driving a car by using petrol and hopefully the majority can afford it.,tp001
0,i think therefore i am,tp001
0,i think theresmore efficeint ways f fueling.,tp001
1,i think they are bad,tp001
1,i think they should be,tp001
1,i think they should be banned,tp001
1,I think they should be banned because hey are poluting the air,tp001
1,i think they should be banned because it ruins our air,tp001
3,i think they should come up with new ideas for why petrol cars should be baned,tp001
1,I think this because  it may be diffucult for long trips. It could also be hard for less  fortunate people to buy an electric car. But I am hopeful that the goverment  will makes this happen the right way,tp001
3,I think this is a blunt instrument statement. It would be better to have a statement saying all NEW cars must be electric vehicles by 2030. I think if this statement came into being the consequences would unfairly target the poor of our community. Government and local government are not providing effective and efficient public transport so the private vehicle is often the only choice for someone working two jobs and travelling a long distance between affordable housing and their work.,tp001
1,i think this is a cool idea because we will have less fossilfuels,tp001
1,I think this is a good idea because fuelcars produse hamful gas into the atmosphere. However if they put a ban towards petrol cars the people with petrol cars will not be abel to do anything with them and they will just be left as junk.,tp001
0,I think this is a great idea and I tottally support it.,tp001
0,I think this is agreat idea and will be great for our planet and environment,tp001

1,I think we have a chance to influence a new way of living. Let go of what is killing our people and our planet and move towards what nourishes us.,tp001
1,i think we may need longer but am optimistic it could eventually be possible,tp001
2,i think we need it,tp001
1,i think we need to be hopeful. with hope. we can do great things and achieve a better tomorrow,tp001
1,i think we need to change,tp001
1,i think we need to invest in electric transport and the infrastructure to support it.    we should all be riding bikes anyway,tp001
1,i think we should be looking in to other options to cars,tp001
0,i think we should be taking action and this is a good way to do it,tp001
1,i think we should have come far enough inalterbative energy technology we wnt have need fo them,tp001
1,I THINK WE SHOULD JUST BAN THE SALES. THEREFOERE EVERYONE DOESNT HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW CAR,tp001
1,i think we will encounter a heap of problems along the way but i think as a country we could  pull it  off,tp001

0,I THINK THAT NZ SHOULD BAND PLASTIC BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DON't recycle there plastic and when they dont it ends up in the ocean and fish will eat it and when they do they might die and people still havent learnt there lesson so when we band plastic hopfully they will learn a lesso,tp007
0,i think that nz should band plastice be cause itis killing the sea anmals.,tp007

1,I think this is exciting hwever the reality is short lived. A change needs to happen with manafacturers. However most single use plastics come from transnational corporations. therefore harder to change for one market? it is good to see coca cola using recycled plastics now.,tp007
1,i think this is ok,tp007
3,i think this will be a big inpact in the world,tp007
1,I think this will be an excellent move for New Zealand and we would be able to lead by example for other countries. I am not optimistic it would happen due to the expense for businesses making this change in the current COVID climate where many are already struggling. ,tp007

4,Banning camping is only addressing the symptom of the issue and not the core problem of disrespect for the land and lack of education.,tp017
4,BANNING freedom camping is not the answer. So much of the rubbish and defication is done by motorists and local residents,tp017
4,banning freedom camping is not the solution. better education is. as long as people know the impact they have on naure they will respect it more. and going out camping and being close to nature makes you want to treasure it because you get to see & experience how beautiful it is,tp017
3,banning freedom camping may cause people to camp in protected or endangerd places.,tp017
4,banning freedom camping will negatively impact tourism and deter young jobless people from visiting the country. less backpackers equal less workforce in the farms. more facilities ( toilets; showers; bins; recycling bins ) would minimize littering and damage to the environment.,tp017

1,i think a few ruin it for most people,tp017
4,I think about you all the time,tp017

0,i think all kararehe are super coooooll,tp017
3,I THINK ALL PEOPLE NEED TO RESPCT OUR LAND,tp017
4,I THINK BACKPACKERS DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY  TO PAY FOR NATURE,tp017
4,I THINK BANNING THE FREE CAMPS WILL NOT LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF TRASH PEOPLE LEAVE BEHIND. WHAT ABOUT WE LOOK INTO SOME OTHER OPPIONS. WHAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM RUINING THE NATURE ?. EG. WHATIF FREEDON CAMPS WERE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICENT EQUIPMENT LIKE RUBBIS BINS etc.,tp017
4,i think camping allows people to get in touch with nature and ultimately protect it more than damage it,tp017
3,i think camping i freedom,tp017
4,i think camping is a nice way to get closer to wildlife unless you want it exticnt,tp017
4,i think camping is fun but its not good to leave rubbish and other things behid,tp017
0,I think camping should be limited because it could hurt the enviroment,tp017
2,i think camping should not be banned,tp017
3,i think campingisawonderfulway forpeople to connect withnature and learn to appreciate it,tp017
0,i think campings fun and exciting because you get to explore other things you didnt know about.,tp017
3,I think educated campers are more respectful to the environement than some people using other types of housing.,tp017
1,I think education is the wayforward. To remove this option is to destroy the enjoyment and envolvement of people in our natural environment,tp017
1,i think everyone who comes to new zealand should respect our lovely country.we dont destoy ither countries when we vist them.,tp017
2,i think free camping is fine,tp017
4,i think freecamp its a really nice way to visit this beautiful country,tp017
3,i think freedm camping if respectful of the environment can bring people closer to nature and have a greater appreciation of the bush. but i thÄ«bk Ä«t should be regulated in at risk areas,tp017
4,i think freedom caming is cool,tp017
1,i think freedom caming is stupid just go to a campsite like the rest of us and stop ruining the environment to fuel you rsuperiority conplex,tp017
3,i think freedom camping goe,tp017
3,i think freedom camping helps connect people to nature although penalties could mitigate negative impacts,tp017
4,i think freedom camping is a good way to see nz. more resources are neededthough,tp017
4,i think freedom camping is a great thing for tourists,tp017
3,i think freedom camping is a kind and generous thing that aotearoa offers so i dont want to see it go. but i care about our natural spaces more,tp017
3,i think freedom camping is a really good idea for visitor and residents because some people have trouble finding housing or don't have the means to rent. Also educating campers so that they are aware if their impact on the land can help everyone,tp017

4,the impat of freedom camping is minimal compared to industries such as mining and logging and so many more. Banning freedom camping is also criminalising homelessness,tp017
1,The important distinction to make is freedom camping instead of all camping. People can still connect to nature in regulated campgrounds and the environment here must be protected. I am from AUS and the environment there is suffering. You have done so well here comparatively.,tp017

3,i think the cat would go mad,tp003
1,i think there should be a law to sterilize cats,tp003
0,i think they are dangerous pets justlike rats. Our society tolerated them in NZ so far only because cats are part of our European culture (where most of cst lovers from) but in reality they dont fit this ecosystem.,tp003

0,i think they should remain indoor domestic pets for their own protection as well as the enviorment protection.,tp003
0,I think this because cats are amazing creatures,tp003
1,"I think this idea is on the right track but not quite right. There should also be an option to have an outdoor ""run"" for cats. Something that allows them the freedom to go outside and sit in the sun but that separates them from birds. A neighbour of mine has one for her cat and it works really well.",tp003
1,i think this is a good idea as so much native wildlife is threatened. but what kind of a life is it for an animal trapped indoors. would conservation ever suggest to keep the birds kept inside?,tp003

Cats are most active and have the most drive to hunt at dusk and at night-time, so by keeping cats indoors when they have their strongest hunting instincts, they are unable to do harm to the native fauna.
