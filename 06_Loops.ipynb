        "# Traversal using `for` loops\n",
        "\n",
        "Being able to repeat the same action over a large set of data is one of the many benefits of learning how to use a programming language. One of the most fundamental ways to repeat an action is through the use of `for loops`. These are called `for loops` because they *loop* or repeat through a sequence of data, objects, values, or whatever you want to call them.\n",
        "\n",
        "What does the `for` mean? The use of \"for\" provides a hint about the way we control `for loops` â€” *for* specifies the units that will be looped over.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's pretend we had a pile of documents that we wanted to shred. Our unit of measurement in this case is an individual document. So, if we wanted to shred each document one at a time, we could formalise this process using the following statement:\n",
        "\n",
        ">`for each document in all of my documents:`  \n",
        "\n",
        ">> `shred the document`  \n",
        "\n",
        "`... repeat until I run out of documents...`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying this idea to Python, a `for loop` allows us to traverse an entire sequence and operate on elements of that sequence. For example, for each value in a sequence, we could:\n",
        "\n",
        "- print the value\n",
        "- use a built in method\n",
        "- create a new variable based on the value\n",
        "- update a counter\n",
        "- perform a conditional test\n",
        "- etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "Much like the `if` statements, the `for` loop will contain a header with a colon followed by an indented body:\n",
        "\n",
        ">`for thing in sequence_of_things:`  \n",
        ">>  `do something`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the following cell to see how a `for` loop works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because a string is a *sequence* of characters, the for loop will go through that sequence one-at-a-time."

        "You may have noticed that there seemed to be a variable in the `for` loop named `letter`. Every `for` loop needs a temporary variable (or an `iterator`) to stand for the value that is being passed to the loop. In the example above, the value of `letter` changed each time the loop was run, starting with \"w\", then \"o\", then \"r\", then \"d\". Because this is a variable, you can set the name of the iterating variable to anything you want. The most common variable used in a `for` loop is the lower case `i`. But, you might find it worthwhile to name your variable something which makes it clear what is being looped over.\n",
