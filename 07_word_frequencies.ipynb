        "\n",
        "In the previous lesson we began exploring how important it can be to analyze the vocabulary of a text in terms of which types of words occur in a text. Now we will expand this exploration to look at numerical distributions of words in a text. `Word frequency` represents the overall frequency of a word in general language use. It is a very interesting property of language because it correlates with other constructs, such as word length (shorter words are more frequent) and word difficulty (more complex words are less frequent). \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the interesting things about frequency is a phenomena called Zipf's law, which states that the most frequent word occurs at least twice as much as the second most frequent word, and this this relationship persists. You can read a [reddit post about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/830nf5/zipfs_law_was_so_cool_that_i_performed_and/), or at least look at the person's graph they made explaining the phenomenon:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, counting the frequency in which words occur with *other* words has proven very insightful for linguistics and NLP. The most basic insight is that words tend to co-occur with other specific words in predictable ways. Corpus linguists call these pairs of words `collocations`, and define them using a variety of different statistical measures. Finding these larger collocational patterns have given strength to functional lingusitic theories of grammar such as construction grammar, which argue that both meaning and syntax determine the way a word is used in language (contrast this with a purely structural approach, which argues grammar rules exist independently of meaning).\n",
        "\n",
        "Word co-occurence statistics are also used to create co-occurence distributions and vector spaces - these are what large-scale NLP algorithms and artificial intelligence applications rely on for word predictions in both processing and production.\n",

        "The simpliest form of a frequency distribution is a count of how many times each word type appears in a text. It's worth pausing for a moment and considering how you might construct your own frequency distribution â€” what might be the steps for doing so? Here is one general approach you could take:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You start a loop over some words\n",
        "2. At the first word, you note down the word and store it in a separate data container, alongside a value representing its frequency (1)\n",
        "3. You then move to the next word and check if the next word already exists in your data container, \n",
        "      - if it does already exist, you increase its count by 1\n",
        "      - If it does not exist, you add it to the data container and set an initial count of 1\n",
        "\n",
