It's not a bad question, and many other people [also wonder](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1708510/list-vs-tuple-when-to-use-each) about this. The main distinction seems to boil down to mutability â€” you can change the values in lists as you like, but tuples cannot change. So, for structures you'd prefer to be set, you may want to use tuples, otherwise use lists. At the end of the day, there is no one \"right\" way to do it.\n"

Extending pre-existing functions, rather than reinventing the wheel each time, is a good way to develop more complex and interesting programs."
