You should spend some time playing around with each individual function to see if you can make tweaks here and there - for example could you add more functions to process texts further? What about a function to auomatically grab the filenames from a directory so you don't have to manually type them? Extending pre-existing functions, rather than reinventing the wheel each time, is a good way to develop more complex and interesting programs. "
