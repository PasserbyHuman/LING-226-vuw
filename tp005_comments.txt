0	i think we should catch as much as we can
1	if we cut the commercial whitebaiting out then more would  surive  maybe  also when it rains heavily the farmers poo ponds flush out and pollute the waterways  as with o waitara riverif you scoop the water its pooey green when it floods
1	whitebait is not a renewable resource and needs to be looked after
1	Human should learn self control           ##### SPORTS BABY
1	if we can bring their populations to a sustainable safe level then we ap people of this land should be allowed. as a way of food andalso popultion control
1	that we get lots of bait
1	as humans we should be making other species go extinct. we need nature but nature doesnt need us. we nust respect all life
1	white bait numbers are stable so fishing has not effected them
1	i eat whitebait fritters yummy and if we eat more we wont starve and i have big muscles because of them yes i am hopeful
1	this is an ok idea that might effect our waters.
1	#### is a lesbian and ##### ##### is wide
1	I DOnt now what I think.
1	hopefull because this generationnot to focused on the out doors ... Tecnology rulingthere lives
1	i love whitebait so we should get all the whitebait because it is the only thing that makesme and my famly happy becaue i have it everyday for lunch #JUSTICEFORMEANDMYWHITEBAITANDMYFAMILY!!! I love iti am a supporter of the whitebaitcommunity.whitebai iswhatimunchonwhilewatchintv

1	the fishery needs management it is a resource to be shared but not exploited
1	if we r allowed to eat as much as we want then they should be doing ok.. right?
1	if we learn to live in balance with nature and how to harvest sustainably it's possible that we can both have our fritter and eat it too
1	i want giantsquid to cone back hope it des :)
1	Because i have lots  of friends
1	because  they shold hope they cach some
1	it would be wouderful but not sustainable
1	it would be better for everyone but im a kid
1	i can eat and catch what i want.i own this land
1	ther should be a limit to how much  whitebait should be caught.
1	i thin we shod breed lots thn can kill and eat lots
1	i like being out side in the ran
1	i found my mum. she was at the start of the place.yay!
1	i think that everybody should be alowed to catch as much as eachother
1	hopefull they can find fish to eat so we don't  die f salvation
1	tasty but dont take too many
1	i thnk that whitebaitis veryy ummy
1	if we all contribute to improve  their habitat there wil be more whitebait
1	that all fish are important for the ecology
1	I think birds are great to be  in the sky right now
1	the expression The sins of the father... is perhaps pertenant to our environmental attitudes ie the future.
1	i am hopeful when im  with slothy
1	BECAUSE I LIKE MY LIFE HEHEHEHE
1	fish have been our mortal enemies for many moons. we shall take back the motherland
1	i do not care about this question
1	because they may go extinct if everyone is allowed to catch as much as they want
1	hopeful means(i hope she is alright)
1	i think it would be cool but thyre endangered
1	i hope that whitebait start recovering from being hunted.
1	it is  concerning to me for to hear this
1	WHITEBAITIS NICE AND A FUNA CTIVITY
1	it might be tasty. havent had any yet fishing is fun as.
1	because pelope are have fun too gethere when they fish
1	i love it as long as it is not overfished
1	everyone should be able to eat as much kai as their stomach needs
1	hey my name is ###### ### im just here to ask for advice on the guy i like
1	Expanding the human population in nz is the problem. xoxo gossip goat
1	we have enough to feed the nation
1	i see you are you a boy ora giril
1	i think hopefuf is to hope people when they need hope
1	i thinkcatch limits are important so everyone can enjoy for years to come
1	because people can eat lots of it
1	THAT WE WILL BE HEALTHER BY EATING WHITEBAITS
1	i hope everyone who cant afford food can have as much whitebaitas theywant
1	because i love whitebait but its really expensive
1	i think that you shouldnt every day but its not bad
1	becouse i want everything to be A.OK!!
1	the actual amount each peron catches is tiny when you look at the size of the westcoast rivers like KAWATIRI R and how many fish travel up and down it all year  locals are sustainable. Blowflies from Chch and Nelson strip the fish for profit and give nothing to the local economy.
1	its okay t do that . and to always be okay ilove u
1	there wil be more fish and chips
1	i think it will workbut other people might not like th idea.but its worth a shot.
1	feeling this way towards the idea because their shouldnt be a limit but then again undecided because no one wants to run out 4?v
1	i think that we should not just leave rubish lying around not even in bags.
1	yum yum whitebiat tasty mhmmm dinner
1	i  think that it is a hopeful idea because then we get more food
1	Hope that  people can fish responsibly and be kind Kaitiaki to Papat®nuku. Only take what you need!
1	we are entitled to hunt and gather.it is the right of the people.  people should be responsible in gathering and respect the natural cycles through knowledge.
1	i love whitebait patties and it may be a hobby for some
1	get  as  much as you need to provide but thats it
1	because i like fat whitebait bunda
1	hi im ##### and im the best because i have a mantion and its the best mantion ever exesting wooo and the reasin is because there cool woooooo this is the best ever because im rich woooo im the best woooo im this best in the world
1	i t is natural course of human action. i am hopeful for my own progressive measures...hopefully
1	whitebait are popular in part based on scarcity because they dont really have much taste
1	its hopeful for the native people  to still be able to put food on the table for their young ones
1	i think they taste like shoes
1	lets hope well get more white bait.
1	recreational is fne stop the comercial or the size of catch
1	plenty of whitebait too much miss information
1	im nice in the wold so ya really ayden  know can stop me in the world sothat meens im the best
1	I WANT TO FUCK THEIR TITAS AND UR NAN
1	i think birds and other  nearly extinct animals should be taen care of same with other fine animals and please take care of the earth WE LIVE ON IT TO!!!!!!!
1	we can help this to stop and help the wild life survive
1	that is will acheve my hopes and dreams
1	i am hopfull that they change it so they have an higher amount but they cant take apregnantone and cant take babys. but as long as they dontget endangerdthey still should be aball to get a resnible amount
2	cause life sucks and most kids wanna die already
2	because the whitebait get eaten and the people who like whitebait are happy
2	because i dont go white bait fishing
2	i don't know or care what white bait is

2	i never really knew whitebaitwas so inportant
2	i eat whitebait when im hungry
2	i don cre means  well lets say i didnt care about omeone
2	fish aint really my go to
2	i dont really eat inanga. so.i dont see the pointin saving them. what do they do for the enviroment? all we really want them for is to end up eating them sooo.
2	Thereshouldbe enough whitebate for everyone so theycan get asuch asthey want.
2	dont care means like you dont care for someone
2	because there are heaps in he ocean
2	peoplemy catch whitebait if they are poor

2	i am not interested in white bait
2	u dot iw  reaky dont kw ht  gng on ght bo
2	white bait   is a good fishing  bait
2	i dont know wat whitebate is
2	i think uuh i think its a carrot
3	well you see im ##### and i care a lot abutwhitebait. also i cant
3	no waitbait would be left so when you go fishing for whitebait only get a little bit save the whitebait!!!!!!
3	Test - I think we need to focus on reducing this catch, while deregulating trout fishing, because they're introduced.
3	not evryonewill hav xonsiderstonfo oh abdill be greedy
3	The whenua and Atua need our help ad aroha
3	i am worried because we will  lose alot of fish and that would mean that there be less whitebait and there wouldnt be anoghfor other people.
3	Be cause we need to conserve r native species
3	i think thatthey are just fish they deserv to live they arejust like humans alive
3	becuase there will be no whitebait left
3	because they arebeencaught in dangerousy high numbers allready
3	we need to be careful and look after our ocean wildlife and not abuse our power as humans
3	i dont want the whitebait to die
3	Allow our fish to rejuvenate and populations to grow...biodiversity is essential for survival and a beautiful home
3	it tastes awful and must be damaging the palate
3	i think the whitebaits will be  gone soon sadly
3	rather they grow into adult native free water fish for our streams
3	White bait is sort after by many fisherman because they  are a delicacy. There are those that take more than enough to sell and white bait are at risk of extiction because of this.
3	over fishing is a negative re future of whitebait
3	because  all of the fish will die
3	cause then once there is no whiefish left the rest ofthe populatin f fish will die abd that will impact the oceans alot.
3	becaue fisheys deserve to live their  fishey  lives happley
3	it is wrong to exploit this species especially because they are already threatened. fishing needs to be sustainable.
3	I recently saw an item of tv saying that some ofour native fish are endangered. whitebait are the babies of these endangered fish.
3	its bad for the fish stock
3	no way of knowing how many caught vs population rate
3	becuse  if we catch all of it then we wonthave anymore fo our seas
3	the government are inept at solving any real problem. humans create problems. politics feeds the problem
3	bla bla bla i am a chater box
3	that i dont have any friends
3	overfishibg will lead t ono fish in ocean ad we beed it
3	i dont like whitebait but i know lots of people like them. if we did enforce this rule they would probly die out.
3	stop eating them. they are going extinct.
3	overfishing is bad and can lead to endangerment of the species
3	because if everyone takes to much at a timethen we will porply have no more waitbait
3	that whtebait hunting could make the species extinct
3	its bad for  the fish and the ecosystem of our oceans
3	because they will run out and extinct
3	Whitebait is native' so it should protected not hunted.
3	e houl foster eco system not be the cause of extinction
3	this my cause a disruption in theecosystem
3	cause then the amount of whitebait will decrease
3	we need to protect whitebait more so they are there for future generations
3	people are greedy. should only take what is needed
3	iwould like whitebait to be around for many generations to come.
3	I thik that with fishers catching lotsof whitebait they could go extinct
3	we run the danger of dramtic decrease in the population if we allow everyone to fish them with no limits
3	WE NEED TO BUILD UP THE POPULATION BEFORE WE CATCH MORE
3	we dont wnt to risk over fishing
3	if to much is harvested the population will decrease dramatically leavig them ixtinct
3	messing with environment is leading us to an end
3	THE TIPUNA OF AREA SHOULD BE ALLWE
3	because there might not be any left  to see
3	they wll go extinct no food for predator
3	if to many people catchas much as they like then others can miss outon whitebait fritters and then eventuallyno one will be able to have whitebaitfritters
3	We'll overfish our native populations before they get the chance to have offspring.
3	We dont even need to catch white bait. It is not a necesity. Just leave the ocean be and let the other creatures of the ocean eat it.
3	I am worried becuase if everyone takes as much as they want thrnthere willbe no beutiful wild life left. Wildlife nustbe rtotected for the future. we need to be responsible for the enivironment. It is a tresure...
3	because therewontbeas much wite bait anymore
3	if we keep driving other things to extinction it will come back round. We have the capcity to be unselfish.
3	need to replenish numbers by areas of protected sea
3	There will be no Whitebait left.
3	I am so worried about these species they do not deserve this. Have your pets orany animal that you like been in danger? If yes then how do you think about this happening! I repeat the species should not be in dangered.
3	if we do not control th? ctch®ng f wh®t?b®t ®t w®ll nt b? r®nd fr lng
3	I THINK THAT MY BROTHR IS ANNOYING
3	ITCANT REPLENISH ASFAST AS CATCHING IT
3	i dont want to see them extinct
3	because we wont have any bigger fish
3	its bad that people are doing this
3	bad idea. species imbalance or extinction possible
3	whitebait tastes great but thats nt an excuse to endanger the population.
3	that it could make the white bait extinked because they might be over fished.
3	we should share what is naturally available to us.
3	I think whitebait may be in trouble if this happens because they might start to go extinct.
3	if everyone was aloud to catch the same amount this could lead to extinction.
3	big corporations shouldnot compete with fisherman
3	because we need to look after our fishies:)
3	that this can cause devastation to the fishing industry.
3	we are running out of whitebait. need for ecosystem
3	polution in our fresh waterways over fishing
3	not a good idea for environment sustainability
3	THERES NO REAL CHECKS AND BALANCES ON THE WEST COAST. WE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SPECIES  BEFORE TAKING THEM.
3	because the enviroment can change drastically if you damage the food chain
3	if we don't limit the catch there soon won't be any more!
3	people take heaps as soon as the season opens
3	L think if people need them . but if you   get so much there are none of them anymore.
3	Many fishing bats catch million tonnes of whitebait each year.BECAUSE OF HUMAN IMPACT A LOT OF FISHHAVE BEEN KILLED
3	we need to live in balance as part of nature not seperate to it
3	catching to meny fish is bad forthe oceon
3	they will became extinct its not a   sustainabe
3	people are killing off more and nore secies but then go and complain about why they are all gone. there needs to be an end to this.
3	there should b enough for everyone o enjoy
3	i think this puts whitebaitat risk of extinction
3	because if everyone gets loads then they will all die
3	idk i guess i just dont think it should happen
3	many peopletake more than they need. they should not be allowed to sell their catch .
3	it is bad to hunt wild life
3	there won't be any fish left
3	it is  bad because whitebait might not be noo more
3	they do alot for the earth
3	because if we keep on taking asmuch as we like there wont be any left for thenext generation!
3	not much info is made accessible for me to make a valid opinion. but if whitebait are on the decline then catching them should be limited
3	im worried for the fish or else there might be no fish to cath
3	there arent much of us left
3	I think that the culture of whitebaiting has become detrimental to the sustainable survival of whitebait.  it is driven by greed.
3	we haveto practise sustainability at all timeswith all our taonga
3	whitebait is going to be extinct
3	leave enough for everyone to share
3	there will be no whitebait if everone can catch infnit.
3	becausei can be worried for the fishies
3	hi im ####### andithink whitebait deserve better
3	i think we are all going 2 die
3	no good. not enough to sustain greed
3	we should not overfish the oceans
3	BEACASE THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY LEFT BUT IM SUE THERE IS PLENTY
3	there will be none left. also there will nont be ennough lefl for  other people.
3	people will take adventage and overfish
3	it should be managedbetter. no comercialfishig
3	i think that ifwe catch to much they will go exctinct
3	they could sll go extinct and that would b sad.
3	it will all be gone if gey do
3	we have to keep the balance of nature alive
3	they are an endangered native species
3	beause that whould kill all whitebait
3	because if everyone catches it just because they can then its not gonna survive and it too wll becomean endangered specie
3	if the white bait are in trouble we should conserve them
3	the same as ###### wont eat the fish
3	i think you takewhat you need for a feed
3	they may run out of whitebait in thefuture as it s unsustaunable
3	kao!! whakaaro e pa ana tangata whena
3	wite bate is extremly rear and well think about it i mean ther ar 5000000 peopl in new zealand and i definitly dont think that ther is enough for all of us
3	reduction in on one species impacts the whole ecosystem.
3	I feel worriedbecause lots of animals are eaten to extinction. This could easily happen to Whitebait and I think NO ONE should be able to fish any fish or hunt any animal. But thats just me.
3	because then the ika would not survive from feeding on the whitebait
3	we would run out of whitebait
3	because there wont be many left.But if there were rules on what can and cant be taken then that will help the whitebait repoppulate
3	The uncotrolled havesting on whitebait is very concerning to the ong term sustainabilty of our endemic fish species
3	i t hink its not giving them much life toexlpore and they will constently die and we will have none left
3	all the cute fisheses mght be eated
3	i think thatif you catch a whitebait you shuld throw it back
3	people should have limts n whatthey catch ther ise they will go extnct sb and thst nakes ne worried
3	all the fish will die and there will be less food
3	we should care for the environment more than ourselves
3	waitbait are a vital part of tge eco system we need to give them time to reproduce
3	because we shouldbe able tobut have limits in order to  repopulate for more fish
3	its a bad idea because if we fish them all there won't be any left! simple as that!!!
3	we have lost a lot of fish i the past years maybe catch a few every now and then.
3	i thibkitis bad and we should elimate them
3	they are indegerand if we starthreding then they well be gone and then noboby alles han see them and it is bad for the eivroment so i saw no that is not okey
3	Overfishing anything isa bad idea. Take care our awa
3	it would break the food chain and other animals would have nothing
3	the max catch for one day should be 1000 a day
3	i think ##### wears g strings
3	Over fishing of any species can deplete their numbers and create imbalances in fragile aquatic ecosystems
3	that we should not be over fishing whitebait
3	because i like white bait omlets
3	we think there are heaps in our rivers but the stories of the past are of huge catches by the bucket load which does not happen now so why is that?
3	Giving peple free reign overcollective resources will inevtably lead to problems
3	we need to stop eating whitebait
3	we will run out of fish
3	if everyone can cach as much as they want the ecosystem won't be balanced and fishor other ocean creatures might be affected  and die
3	I Think that if we catch as much whitebait as we want then they might go extinct and tht might have n effect on other creatures!
3	we must work with mother nature
3	cci think worried because know one should really hert wild life and whitebait belongs to the ocean and if we keep eating them they could get exsticed to our beuatifull country sotry not make our country fade away because theres more to see
3	because the will become extinct too soon
3	the whitebait population is declining in our area
3	issa very bad idea i promise now go stream my songs
3	too much taking by a few wankers
3	I think that there shoud be restrictions on how muchyou can get   and where you catch them.
3	i think people should care more about the environment  because tswhere we live they shhould buzz off
3	because there should always be a limit tohow much you can catch
3	letting everyone catch as much whitebait as possible is opening the door way to extinction.
3	bcausse if it is i danger
3	i dont want whitebait diying out.
3	that we should fish them a little less and maybe fisha little bitmore of oter fish to even it out
3	The best way to protect the yeti is to let him go.
3	the are babies. we need them for the future
3	humans seem to be a threat to the rest of the world
3	preserving a species is lot more important than how good something tastes
3	i just think its so unfair on the whitebait. i mean if a lot of them are in trouble we shouldnt make there be even less of them.
3	we need to let the babies grow
3	There should be a controlled amount of Whitebait caught each year to help Whitebait populations.
3	Everyone has theright to catchwaitbait fish but when you doit for no survival purposelikeyou need the food i feel its unethical. imgine killingtones of humans just for fun... not for food or need... its unnesery death and waste we could be protecting.
3	people are greedy  they would cause the whitebait population to drop without monitoring or respect
3	I'm worried because they might go extint
3	because then they will probably die for no reason because they will catch too much
3	its time we started caring about species destruction
3	i feel we need to be sustainbleand prtect whitebait for the future
3	how can we  be sure all have as muchas we want
3	That would be bad for the whitebait and they would go extinct.
3	its notok because i thinkim worriedabout it because i think its not ok because i think its not ok becsause i think its not ok because its not okk ok ok ok ok kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
3	i think you should only take enough for a meal as this is a precious species toall NEW ZEALANDERS
3	Because of how fragile these ecosystems can be
3	if you ceep catching them then there wllbe none left!
3	if everyone is free to catch as much as they want i am worried they will be exploited and go extinct like a lot of our other natives
3	there hitebit is becoming a scarce resource
3	because then we willnot have many white bait left
3	If we are able to catch as much whitebait as we like then species may go extinct and ecosystems may be affected.
3	because if everyone ws out to get whitebait there would none of those species left and we need them because theyre native.
3	never gonna give up never gonna let you down never gonna rub around and dessert youuuu!!!!! i think ther should be a certain amount of whte bait you can fish for
3	people should no be free to take what is the lands in the first place
3	we should not allanimals but pests are good so people should not be alowed to.
3	i dont want them to go extint
3	i think that its not a good idea and i dont wuder stad
3	How will that affect marine life. What concequences will it have
3	With out the small fish like white bait the biger fish that eat them will have no food and eventually die out.
3	#### can be  very sillysilly man sometimes
3	no whitebait who do we give pelled o?
3	we dont wnt to run out
3	###### white bait fit in your mouth
3	we should stop hunting fish because if we huttoo much then we wont have anymore
3	i think it should be monitored and limited
3	i think it need some control . limit the take per day/event
3	sustanable fishng should be the aim
3	THE BENEFIT FOR A FEW VS THE GOOD FOR ALL.
3	hey you go have a shower
3	i thinkyou should only v be able to catch whitebait if your a fishernman
3	overfishing can cause an ecosytem imbalance and deplete food from other species
3	over fishing is a problem. we need to be better abd follow the rules
3	limit catch or allow species to recoverwith a stand down period
3	because they are endangered they shouldnt be caught
3	A need to protect what  we have better management and control
3	we are running out of all marine resources from the tiniest whute bait to the biggest whale
3	they are going to get instenct beacose of us
3	controlled amount should be considered. not as much as they want
3	need to replenish before you can keep fishing
3	itll become extinct fast if this is the case.
3	there is plenty of food out there . let ourwaters florish firstbefore taking all. thankyou
3	There would be very little or no White Bait left in our streams.
3	our taonga species are too important
3	that may not be enough babies
3	Extinction of whitebait means that muliple chains of the foodchain will break. thatis bad. for everyobe
3	Fish makeup an imporant ecosystem and the ocean is most of earths surfce so without fish the oceans will be ruined
3	beacuse then they will come extinct
3	because i don't want the population to decrease anymore tan it already has :(
3	NO PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO SOLELY DO AS THEY WISH. EVERY ONE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF EVERYONE ND EVERY CREATURE
3	i am concerned that with everyone taking whitebait will reduce the supply and then be extinct
3	needs a ca like all other fish
3	there should be law of restrictions
3	because they have lives as well as humans
3	idk fish will die and stuff
3	this is bad because some species are endangered and we want to save them for the future
3	i am worried about there not being any whatebait left in our awa and our moana
3	3 of the 5 specie are endandered juveneilles
3	then no one willhave anymore whitebait in thefuture
3	they are going to become extinct because no one wants to take care of our oceans we should do this together as one family
3	like every other kind of fishing quotas are needed
3	catching small fish doesn't make sense
3	i think  they shoud but alsonot
3	fishing requires controls to ensure species can repopulate
3	having watched seaspiracy the demand for fish in general has reached an all time high and is destroying marine life. However fish is extremely important for our overall health. We just need better regulations of the fishing quotas that needs to be addressed across the world.
3	they are a threatened species. some limits must be in place
3	as tasty as those little swimmers may bewith an egg and some salt and pepper the fact youneed hundreds for a snack is wasteful greedy and a little nonsensical. people is stoopid
3	no we need to share it for the future
3	i think that whitebait fishing needs to be managed to ensure the species can be protected for the future.
3	if we take too much therewont be any for future generations
3	i think limits on  how much you take are neccesary and important to know the future concequences so dont tske more than you need
3	no one should eat living creatures
3	becuse istill want them to live but then we wont have witebaite so there soldbe alimitof about 50 a week but if thay becomeintrobleweshold not have it and let them have babys
3	because then we would be having  not enoth white bait for any one else
3	there should be areas where no fishing of whitebait occurs. these areas could be on a rotation biannually or trianually
3	because its yummy but i dont want it to go away
3	How can we ensure whitebsit will still be available for future generations if they are some sustainable management practices in place.
3	they are endangered and people are too greedy
3	The Whitebait is like all other animal populations. If everyone takes as much as they want we will all eventually have nothing.
3	because we will soon nolongerhave  any if we keep taking
3	because they will die and extinct
3	we should protect our scarce resources
3	People might catch more than they need therefore it might not be good for the ecochain as wellas economy.
3	because i wantedto go see my cousin beforeshe leaves. an so i hope i do x
3	Whitebait are gross and shouldnt be eaten
3	We should protect nature and put restrictions on human consumtion of a whitebait.
3	I think its going to make fishdisapear more easily so maybe we should restrict our number of catching fish a little smaller. Thank you.
3	if humans hunt too much there wont be any left for future generations to enjoy and experience the way that we have
3	humans are selfish.  we take eveything and give little back to the earth.
3	I think that we shouldn't be allowed because soon after they will all beextinct and we won't have any at all
3	we will run out of white baitif we take as much as we want because some people will want lots
3	we will lose them altogether if we are not careful
3	there will be no more whitebait
3	then theremight not be as much tobpopulatebext season
3	the ecosystem cant handle overfishing and itll directly impact other organisms
3	wow i am going to thewar place
3	as a child I remember bucket loads. so must be over fished and also state of nga awa.
3	i think if we catch as much fish aswewant to the fish cannot have babbies and thelittle fish will die without there parents so we will have no fish to eat andsame for the animals.
3	Should always have limitations to catching any lifeform
3	we need whitebait for the future
3	i am scared for the whitebait :(
3	we need to protect ournative species.
3	it is a very ignored issue and it isnt just coming from the cows  and we need t figure outwhere it is coming from
3	people cant catch as much as they want because that would be cruel to whitebait
3	over fishing will deplete the resource
3	Whitebait are absoultly essinal  to our eco system I am appaled to see the coments posted on here shame on you bone brains
3	should not be allowed to sell whitebait
3	I want to eat them but do not want them to be extinct.
3	We might lose our whitebait species ifthey are not given a chance to recover.
3	Whitebait will most likely become extinct
3	because we might run out of fish
3	some people will take more than what is sustainable
3	the ocean will be empty by 2050. whitebait are babies. theyshould survive
3	there will end up being none left
3	we need to be mindful on our footprint we have on our nature and be more sustainable
3	There are limited resurces that we all need to share. There is no need for greed.
3	i think   that  no fish means no food in the fufer
3	I think we owe it to ourselves and our children to treat the planet responsibly. If we don't work together for sustainability there won't be anything left for future generations to enjoy.
3	it is bad because fish could becoe extinct
3	this is a very unsustainable way dealing with this problem
3	some people may take advantage of tgis and exploit streams and rivers.
3	it can impact our ecosystem in many ways. it might not seem signifiant at first but every extinction has repercurssions in my opinion
3	we need to live sustainably therefore protect our resources for all
3	I think they they should stop over fishng white bait because we should
3	i think we should not catch as much as we want cuz its bad
3	becouse then thay will get extinct and then you world not be abell to make food withit in it
3	74 p?r c?nt f ntv?f®shr? thr?t?n?d w®th ?x®nct®n
3	we  need to fish for tomorrow
3	because its not very bussin to kill things lol
3	Must be careful we're not over eating a spcies to extinction!
3	big companies shoul stop. but we all shoul be able to fish our food
3	they should limit the quantity. save earth
3	I am worried about this idea because I do not want any morespecies to go extinct
3	they will die out. ban fishingfir 5years let them spawn.
3	shouldnt eat them until they are common
3	it  willbe sad to see more natives go extinct
3	the whitebait are soon going to be out fished and the whole waterway ecosystem will collapse resulting in poisonous water  for all animals including us. we are killing this beautiful country
3	taking too much out of the ecosystem surely will have a negative effect
3	its bad fish fingers deserve 2 be in ocean #crunbedfishisyucky
3	they will overfish and wipe out species.
3	who ever is  excited is greeddy:/
3	as a collective we tend to over source this is worrying not only for hedecreasig number of whitebait species but for ay of our other natural resources
3	I hadn't heard about this until now
3	because f we catch allwe wobt have any fis
3	i might catch a native bird or somthing
3	how long do we let our desire for luxury goods (in this case "whitebait") dictate our systematic destruction of yet another wild food source? we are too numerous as a people to be hunter gatherers. We must address the issue and find a long term solution while we still can.
3	i think no because you are eating all the baby fish and if there  is no babyfish then there will be no more fish
3	We need to recognise our role as guardians.
3	the fish will be extinct if  we dont look after them!!!!!!
3	i think that if people catch as much white bait as they wish they will go extinct
3	free reign on whatwe can has always led us downhill. allow th fhing and thr fun but respect our nature as we should. a little money isnt worth the harm to our environment.
3	It is us humans that are making everything change and go extinct. We need to do something to stop this problem. NOW!
3	We need to control stocks of every fish before its too late
3	that poop smell bad like dad
3	I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT OVERFISH BECAUSE THEN THERE WILL BE NO ONE TO REGULATE HOW MANY SEA PLANTS WE HAVE. THE WHOLE FOOD CYCLE WILLALSO BE DESTROYED.
3	i guess im greedy then ##
3	There will be none left if we take as much as we want.
3	they should swim and b wet
3	we are breaking thefood chain. LOTS IF ANIMALS NEED WHITEBAIT MORE THAN US.Even if we catch whitebait we shouldnt waste
3	they would die and not be able to breed
3	Some people would take advantage of this and start to over-fish. This causes extinction
3	me rhuitia te h® i ?nei momo ika
3	because therewill not be enof for eeryoneand there is not thatmch white bate
3	whitebait are baby fish that wont have thecha nce to grow
3	we are too thoughtless as individuals
3	i think we should only catch what we can consume
3	i think that thats bad for the environment because tat neabs there us no fod fr other fish to eat
3	if we have to much whitebait for ourselves there will be none eft
3	i think that people should not  have the right to take all the fish because if we take them all and then they will become extinc t and noone will be able to enjoy the fish and that would be bad.
3	because  some shark night be in there
3	it makes me worried because if we lose to much fish well thats bad
3	i think tould reallyhurt th nviroment
3	there should be a limit because it reduces the oceans ecosystem
3	it is imporant to the survival of the species
3	we should take care not to catch too many waitbait
3	we should put a limit on how much white bait we catch
3	im worried for the future of my children and the impact humans are having on the environment
3	let the fish grow big before you catch them
3	if everyine takes as much as theywant soon there will be none left
3	dont want to run out of it nottoo good
3	if everyone cotributes to catching as nuch whitebait as they want then whitebait might become extinct and part of the food chain might disappear.
3	need a limit so everyone ets their share
3	whitebait need to be a protected species. rahui untill numbers recover
3	you take all you want often will lwad to waste.  with whitebait you need to leave some to return to the sea in readiness for the nxt years run
3	people are mean to me at school.
3	i think there shoud be a limitso there can be repopulation as if more people catch whitebait it may cause extinction which will beway worse!!!!
3	we need to stop destroying their habitat and stop blaming fishing
3	there will be none left if anyone can take as much as they want
3	we shiuld look after our unique species
3	this could lead to extinction of some species
3	we need t think about the fture and the impact of not monitering our consumtion can do t future whitebait population
3	becauses if we catch to much then they could go exstinked
3	i m worrid because i dont  think thisis a porreite
3	I think humans hould stop ruining the earth and look for more sustainable ways to eat ratherthan desecrating our oceans through commercial fishing.
3	if we catch all the whitebaitit will go extinct
3	take what need but never fron greed
3	because they could all go extinct
3	we need to stop overfishing our seas
3	that the whitebaitwill run out. #justice for the whitebait
3	becauseif we keep taking without goving back then we will lose what is important to nature and there wont be any left
3	I  think the birds need more space in the air   and   sky right now.
3	because overfishing effects the whole ecosystem
3	We need to protect for future generations but more importantly to protect our precious ecosystems
3	because we need to keep our fishies safe:)
3	let the babies grow to their potential if ever human needs to harvest them.
3	we should  only fish within our means or not at all
3	i thnk that the whitebait coud go extinct if the humans take more than they need and dot care about the evironment. i think that hmns should  take care about hw much they take.
3	because most whitebait species are native. I mean how will we recognize native species? we might overfish because of that
3	we need to look after for futuregenerations
3	managing this resourse for future generations
3	athough i dont like to eat them but we should protect them just like other animals.
3	i think that if everyone could get as much as they want we wouldnt have much left enough for all people
3	because their wont be eny waitbait left
3	if we fish too much that means there wil not be enouh for others
3	i dont want us to run out
3	because then  no one could see them again
3	im worried because ifeveryobe has this mindsetthan soon there will be none left.
3	season should be restricted to 2 weeks
3	Many people are very greedy and would catch too many and they would become extinct.
3	because we should not take things that are already in trouble
3	there should be daily limits for all nzs
3	because i dont want it to go extinct
3	regulations on fishing preser forfuture generations
3	This s already a species in decline.
3	they will be gone sadly if we  keep this up
3	that the hite bait will get die
3	we must conserve what we have.
3	I  am worried about  white bait cause their mommas and daddas will be sad.
3	we impact nature enough already. we have access to so much we need boundries so nature has a chance to thrive.
3	we need to control the amount we catch to ensure it survives
3	i think if we catch white bait in cirtant areas so the population doesnt go down to much
3	we need to have limitedcatching to give species a chance to thrive
3	conservation is neccessary for future generations
3	pressure on survival of the species
3	people will eventually run out of whitbait and start killing other ish
3	if we take too much therewont be enough. peopleneedmderation
3	History dictates we will eat them into extinction. They wouldnt be the first
3	then pople might over fish them
3	if the fish is in danger throw it back but go ahead if not
3	people should lessen howmany animals they eat.
3	there is a decreasing number of all species of fish
3	we may run out of fish and it is not sustainable as it disruts the lifecycle
3	we need to keep a balanced eco system
3	the whitebait popullation coul suffer because of it
3	they are in decline. we should protect them like we protect our birds
3	you shoudnt b able to have unlimted allowance to any reasorce
3	the loss and lack of fish andother sea life
3	all other natural resources are regulated. whitebait is not in infinate supply
3	that they will be over caught and made extinct
3	I think that there are too many whitebait fishings recently. If there are WAY too many there will be none left to fish...
3	hitebait might go extinct nd that isnt good
3	if they are endangered we need to conserve them so they can repopulate so we are able to have them around forever
3	i think that the food chan will de come inballnst
3	there needs to be limits on how much people cancatch
3	that we need to populate before we take
3	is not good for nature and ecosystem
3	we need to help pickup rubbish
3	If we were allowed to catch as much whitebait as we wanted then they would go extinct in NO time flat. It would be HORRIBLE for our eco system too.
3	because they will go extinct :(
3	BECAUSE WHEN SONEONE TAKES TO MUCH THE U HAVE NONE LEFT
3	the species needs protecting so it can continue to survive and be enjoyed for generations to come
3	it could be a huge  risk
3	we will run out due to greed
3	we need to keep control so they dont go extinct
3	people might get sad that they dont get enogh fish
3	because we need to protect our kai moana
3	i am alitte worried because if people keep catchig as much whitebait asthey want they might go extinct and we should only take what we need
3	its important to preserve our resources for future generations.
3	if whitebait catching is uncontrolled we will fritter them all away
3	over fishng results in a disruptioninthe aquatic ecosystem. there will be greaterimpacts than just this breed of fish
3	sustainability for future whanau is most inportant
3	because otherwise all the fish be extinct
3	Theres other things for us to eat instead of endangering another species.
3	WE DONT KOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE SPECIES .
3	we cant just keep taking to the point of destroying these species or any species.
3	it should not be able to besold!!!
3	Some people would not want to catch any whitebait at all
3	i think that if people catch as much waitbait as they want there wont be much of waitbait in wildlife anymore
3	They will be over fished. People are greedy.
3	that they could go extinct from over consumtion
3	yeah the fish will totally nt be extinct!!!! totally... (sarcasm)
3	The oceans ecosystem requires a certain amount of white bait to remain for it to be sustainable and not be affected by fishing. over fishing would occur if not managed.
3	i amwored because we might lose bate
3	i am worried because it is scary
3	i like whitebait butbeause of greed they could be fished out.
3	we dont want them to go exstinkd
3	disruting the lower rungs of an ecosystem has huge effects all the way up.
3	dont want the few to ruin it for the rest
3	Because for other creatures to survive they need to eat whitebait. So if whitebait    numbers are low this affects more than just humans
3	the more they are hunted theless they can breed
3	we should protect the numbers of whitebait to ensure they are not too low.. unlimited acess is risking their population
3	IF EVERYONE TAKES MY KAI THEN THERE ISNT ANY MORE FRITTERS!
3	We all needto consider the domino effect of loosing a species on the greater ecosystem. We are part of that and rely on it for food and survival
3	we need tohave limits tohelp species recover and notbecome extinct we all have our part in the eco system
3	if they are in trouble because of human inpact why make it worse!!! life depends on balance and humans have ruined it!!
3	we will fish them into extinction if we arent careful
3	you should only take enough to eat for your family
3	we need to respect native fish and not overfisk
3	there should somewhat be a limit
3	if this happens there wont be enough left
3	it might cease the existance of a lot of fish species
3	overfishing is not good for the planet
3	i love eating them but the must be fished in  a sustainable way. peoplqe should not take more than they need. if people cant make good decisions around tthis th only options will be government restrictions goveqrnentgovernment
3	I an very worried because if people catch hudreds of Whitebsit a day then sooner or lster people will b askig to catch Blue Cob exct It is a very bad idea because sooner or later all the fish may as well die or be court
3	because i like whitebait but i can go without eating them for a bit i guess to eat some later
3	i  think that we will not have any left
3	im worried that they will become extinct from over fishing.
3	i am very sad abuad this
3	with the human population ever expanding we need to mange what we eat.
3	always need healthy balance which means regulations and restrictions are necessary
3	people take too much kai moana usually more then they need
3	limited amounts outthere so do not want them caught toextinction
3	bc they might die bc were eating them.
3	because these fish  can go extict
3	i  think people should not catch whitebait beacause all the whitebait will die.
3	eat all tha babies there be no big fish
3	its not good because we won't have much fish left
3	because they might catch to much then they may go extinct. also because they are animals and theydeserve to live like we do.
3	that too many will be taken
3	I understand it is a delicacy but we must also protect our wild life. Otherwise what will our rangatahi and mokopuna.
3	the nature is not ours to exploit and we should have limits n how much we can take
3	we should slow down on getting white bait because they are in danger
3	i think that there should be a quota like with all fish. other wise peopleget greedy.
3	Almost an extinct species. Only take what you need. Not what you want. Waiho!!
3	whitebait should not be exported or commercially sold if it is in trouble. recreationally is fine as doesnt impact stock as much.
3	there should be fish in the sea
3	I think that whitebait is a delicacy but if it is over fished there will be none left for anybody else.
3	overfishing is how ecosystems start to collapse. Fritters are not worth the biosphere
3	if we catch too much we will exaust the supply. we should license like all other fresh water fishing in our rivers and lakes
3	because it would lead to too many people tryig to fish for whitebaitand most likely lead to their extinction
3	we should show  restraint to preserve our wildlifee
3	because fish species thatare calledwhitebait are protected
3	We should be working together to prevent extinction of further species
3	There shouldbe limits in place so the supply doesnt run out
3	the whitebait will be hunted till extinction
3	ithinkif you fish all the whitebiat they my eventually go extinc. simple as that.
3	If everyone takes what they want we will end up with none for everyone; and a permanently altered natural environment. We need to share and limit ourselves to care for this world.
3	im worried i might fall over and hit my head hard!
3	he nag toa it tekai n thewhanau
3	no thats bad to the fish!!!!
3	simply because resources must be shared not depleted
3	birds need fish to eat bro
3	because if we kill whitebait for bait it will go exctinct
3	the prey wont have food for them selves
3	because they are important to the ecosystem
3	because it willmake them go extinct
3	cause we shoud stop wit overcatch all the animals around the world and change in a selfsufficement life
3	give hem a chance olive and prosper.
3	that whitebait will be over fished
3	they too will be extinct in 50 years if we continue
3	white bait are cool but idk nything else aaaahhhh
3	i think that if we can catch them in certain areas with a certain amount it would be fair.
3	over fishingcan lead to extinction :(
3	people should know what are they catchin. then we know is not endangered ones
3	Wait bait will go exctinct  if we catch to much.
3	Given the species is endangered we should take account for that and protect it.
3	well rub out please sop catchibg them
3	We should look after  wild stock and move to aquaculture alternatives for demand
3	eventually no one would have any
3	limits sould be in place to permit population renewal and regrowth of surrounding ecosystems
3	i think that the white bait would disappear.
3	BECAUSE there won t be any left and we will lose a native species
3	most people take lightly or dont care about other species.Education n good role models would help
3	ithinkits sad becaus it is a animal and theyare very cool animals
3	EVEN IFYOU TELL PEOPLE TO NOT CATCH THAT MUCH FISHS TILL MANY PEOPLE DONUT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO TRY TO HELP.WE SHOULD RESPECT OTHERS
3	the popuation of NZ has outstripped the supply
3	because they are under so much pressure with dams and modified waterway routes.
3	if eceryone caught lots we would run out and they woud go extinct
3	.worried abot losing all our native birds
3	even if you dont like to eat whitebait we should still preserve a balanced eco system of renewal
3	if we dont have a healthy thriving marine life our species is threatened
3	quota for all. No commercial fishing.
3	that if white bait fish species ar e in troblethat there should be a limit to keep the fish alive and  that there fish for everyone onthe years to come so we do nt need to put a ban on white bait fish for the people who love eat ingwhite bait all fish species should be health
3	how big fish if eat all small fish
3	sha re the surplus but nurture  fish and itshabitat
3	I get worried because i have never had it.
3	i have a feeling  something bad will happen
3	If whitebait is in troube we should limit it as low as possble
3	wewant to protect the species for the future
3	because if we keep fishing  the whitebait they will go extinct
3	we need to fish sustainably across all species to ensure their protection
3	i worry they might go extinct
3	my heart breaks when i think of all the poor little whiteait eing eaten. the future is looking dire
3	becaus if we can then the white bait might becom extinct and i am a vegetarian
3	natural resources are limited and humans dont always think about the long-term impact of our individual actions
3	i don't like it. If we run out of waibait then it will be upsetting.
3	i am little worried because the sea animals have nothing to eat andpeople should be worried because  white bait is a fish abd that atracts ather fish
3	whilst in theory this would be fine. in practice western consumtion patterns driven by capitalist and neoliberal ideals mean that the concept of want goes well beyond what we need and what the environment can cope with.
3	thoughtless overfishing leads to endangered species and eventuallyextinction
3	because when its gone..... its gone for good
3	overfishing so no time for them to grow
3	there should a limit they are less every season
3	whitebait fritters are my favourite but w need to conserve their species beforebthey go extinct
3	If we do there won't be any left to catch.
3	we all ove to eatwgitebait butwe wont be abe to eat  themanmore if theyare xtibct
3	DO NOT PUT RUBISH ON THE GROUND IT KILLS TURTTLES
3	the cant grow up and breed and freed other scecies
3	if everyone took as much as they wanted there would be none left
3	fish are cool i do not want them all to die my g
3	if u catch as much whitbait as u can want more like you can get then  the other fisher man or woman will not catch so i reccemend jut catch mybe like 5  each day and 2 fish at night so no donot catch as much as u want another reason is the baby fish wil not live there life thx ..
3	extinction wukld ve a najr bruh moment
3	becase people   need to share it evenly and if people keep taking loads of them  there wont be any left
3	they will be wiped out like the rest of our fisheries
3	When a species is gone it is gone. Humans have the capacity to choose. We shold choose to be good to the creatures of the world and each other.
3	the government is lying to us
3	because if people fish to much white bait there will be no more left
3	its stupid to kill baby animals and expect a species to thrive
3	i think we shoud be moderate in our use of natural ressources. we cant always do watever we want as it impacts others
3	they are at risk of being over fished
3	We always seem to over use our resources and i think we are on track to do the same thing with whitebait.we need to protect them before its too late
3	cus whitebait is like endabgers or smoething and if it is ovr fished thatsbad
3	i worried because there might be no more soon
3	because of future and unexpected outcome or events
3	i think that the whitebait will become extint and their native so thats bad
3	I think that you have a big bum and its scary
3	i think thatif everyne took as much whitebait as they wanted we would run out
3	i think that theyshould beable to have a lot of amount but of acertain size and they cant take pregnant fish they should have a limit off a certainumber butnot too low
3	sustainability. careful planning of resources should be managed to ensure availability for future generations.
3	sustainability should be considered as a necessity and be at the forefront of any methods of foraging or gathering of finite natural resources
3	if people eat all the whitebait there will be no whitebait left  - Master Oogway
3	because the whitebait will go extint
3	we need to be more aware of our impct on the ocean and only take what we need so the generations after us can be provided for and experience what we have!
3	needs to be more heavily regulated
3	because it might kill all the white bait
3	i think we need ##### ### and her gang
3	whitebaitis living soo i am worried
3	i want my chidren and grand childrento be able to see whitebait and maby even catch them
3	i think we should all getan opportunity to catch whitebait atleast once in our lives
3	youshould be able to catch a feed but not sell it
3	because i like whie bait but think its over fished
3	this will decinate the numbers going on to mature to full gtoth
3	there needs to be eough for the spexies tsurvive soa quotois beeded
3	people take too much. there may be a lot now but not forever
3	i think that you shouldnt becaue they will become extinct
3	its gotten out off hand and peope are trying to make money off of it
3	because it interrupts the biological cycle
3	I know how important they are to waterways andother things. Most dont know or undersand. Ignorance is dangeros
3	They will become extinct if we continue to fish them.
3	reaching a critical mass it should be controlled
3	we must sustain our indigenousspecies fr all to share and toupport the envirnmental balance
3	because there endangerd and we need to tke care  of mother naturelike the way t does for us
3	we need to leave them alone
3	fish are pretty much keepingus alive we shoudn't eat to many of them expeshely their babys because there babys make more babys if we eat all the babys the fish will become extict
3	this is a sacred maori resource im afraid our land and environment wont be able to sustain us anymore
3	because the whitebait need to grow up to reproduce but they cat because the are caught
3	loss of species x5.... and habitat
3	taek it easy on them. there should be max and a licence obtained first.
3	catching to much of something can be dangeorous towards the spesies and to the envoroment
3	should only take enough foryourself and whanau. toogreedy
3	we could lose these fish frever
3	NOT ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AND NO TIME FOR MORE TO GROW
3	fishibg shouldonl be allowed if t is proven to be sustainable
3	Whitebait are endangered because we are overfishing them.
3	all the fish will get caught and will go extinct if thereare boundris then they won't ll l®v? t b? ?njy?db g?nrt®ns t cm?
3	we need to ensure their survival
3	i think by allowing everyone to catch as much whitebait aspossible meansthe species will go extinct. its our job to nurture not only people but our ecosystem as well.
3	because they are part of the food chain like any other fish
3	they might all die and people could be greedy. they could go extinct
3	we need to prioritise their ecological importance
3	because they wont be enoughof them
3	whitebaiting should only be done if there is enough to last every generation
3	i think there is become extinct because cuzzys get to hungry on the white bait
3	their are so many pressures upon whitebait including loss of habitat/ pollution and unregulated fishing I am worried for the future of life in our waters..
3	because i dont want them to go extinct
3	we will run out if everyone takes what they want
3	because there wont be enough for future generations.
3	this the only fish i can think of that it legal to sell. large amounts get sold by only few whitebaiters. it should be for your own use only. that should lesson the pressure onthe resource
3	sistwhitebait catches should be restricted as they are baby galaxiids and need to migrate in order to avoid trematode parasite infestation but if we eat toomany of them the population will not persist
3	if we are also destroying habitat we might not have fresh water fish in the future
3	there shouldalways be strictions on hunting and fishing
3	that there will be no more fishin the ocean.
3	I FEEL WORRIED BECASE theyare endangered
3	because we need toprotect species fron human greed
3	because if we hunt them down there will be no more of them.
3	if whitebait are endangered you shouldnt kill them
3	we need to plan for the futue
3	There should be no more commercial fishing of whitebait
3	ka ngarohia era kai ka ngarohia hoki nga tangata i konei i Aotearoa. With every passing moment life lost to humanity will eventually mean humanity itself is lost. Saving only those who desire to rule the world...
3	I think its not nice to take fish out of its home.
3	worried means that someone might be doing somthing thats dangeores and you worried
3	im worried about i will die tommorow because i have a little scratch
3	lead to the extincion on native new zealand species
3	all the babies wont be able to grow into the big fish
3	becuase it would be breaking the food scikil for sharks exetra
3	You're eating the future adults reventng replacement of the future population
3	i am worried there wonnt be any more soon
3	i dont want it to run out
3	i dot want them to become extinct
3	that if we eat all the  witebait there will be non left
3	im worried because im scared that there will be over fishing
3	ifvdg f fbh g hwont go home
3	we hav idntified some species are   endangered. iff we wabt them around in twenty years
3	Unfortunately greed exists and it is disappointing and concerning that people take more than what is required
3	would like future generations toenjoy whitebaiting
3	we should not be getting all of them we should save some to grow
3	That if we catch to much they will die out.
3	because in my opinion whitebait is currently overfished
3	yvzhgkdhshdd jid jj fhfdjh cdscxmxd dhjgvzzBZVXHHBVJJBCJBKBKC
3	hist may affect the trout population i think
3	i think it needs to be monetered
3	You should be required too obtain a liscene
3	we should not catch too many. leave  some for the future generation
3	people only look ot for themselves
3	theyll be none left if its unlmited
3	i think we need to stop over fishing
3	were gonna fub out of fish
3	theydhouldstop being mean and cruel but im not angry about it. just worried.
3	tera pea ka mate nga inanga katoa
3	we must to protect any life
3	im more worried about commercial fishing of the ocean
3	i dont want them to become extinct
3	I am super worried about the trees. because   we CANNOT live without our beutiful trees. please help them!!
3	govt shoul ban all commercial exploitation and introduce limits for recreational
3	spawn of ournative fish. its a no brainer that it should be regulated
3	i am worried that the fish could become extinct
3	because if people catch as much as they want then whitebait will go extinct.
3	it is not sustaiable long term
3	if we catch more white bait they will run with thedinos to heaven then in  other words they will run exticint
3	f everyone takes as much as they wantiheremightnot beany left
3	for the sake of species preservation this is a silly idea
3	overfishing leads to lack of diversity and damage to ecosystems
3	If everyone just catches as  much as they want. They might push whitebait to extinction.
3	as we want have many left
3	whitebait might not be healthy for you
3	because animals in the wild are not a limitless resource.and need time to replenish
3	the earth cannot replenish fast enough
3	i they shoud not because oter wise they might die out. We should take care of our environmentnot break it down even more.
3	its food for other animals and if we eat all the whitebait we will hunger them out
3	its lik ging extinc i bnot???? we shkkdnt ocer fish because itsbd my mum says so
3	because they are endangered or at least borderline. the loss of one means more species to follow
3	we dont want to run out!
3	there is not enough whitebait so the species would become endangered
3	i think that it should only be a little
3	we should look after the numbers that can be caught
3	because fish are almost gone like whales.
3	there won't be enough for everyone
3	fishing for fishies dont make them feel happy. By king gzzard and the lizard wizard
3	i think it would be sad
3	This is very dangerous to our whitebait and theyre at risk of extnction and it would be sad to see those little fellas go :(
3	they are being exploited by a few hungry  people who dont care
3	because they are cute little fish and they dont deservie todie
3	If too many poeple tack it we wont have enof
3	we shold care more about out ecosysten. it keeps usalive afterall.
3	if vry one takes as much as the wnt there will be none left for futre generations to come
3	will be no renewal if take as much as you can
3	im worried becase i alive things
3	They are part of our amazingecosystem and other creatures also rely on them . ifwe use something in our environment we need to use it with  careful moderation
3	dont want there to be none
3	it needs to be regulated to protect the ecosystems and ocean
3	if we have no white bait rivers wont be as cool
3	then they will be over fished
3	bc extinction may be a possibility
3	Then there is not enough for everyone else and not enough for repopulation
3	what if we run out of whitebait
3	they need to be protected like other fish
3	there are commercial fishers reaping thewaters
3	this will unbakance our waters and kill us all
3	whitebait will run out in the future
3	I think it is not right.
3	lots of people think there yummy I don't.
3	current expectations are unsustainable for the breeding population
3	we have lots and lots of fih but we souldnt take somuch
3	i am  very worried becouse they migt get extinked
3	Once they're gone - they're gone forever
3	save the new zealand river trout
3	you need to make sure that there are enough for biodiversity and future generations
3	team of five million applies in many contexts.  share now and look to the future too!
3	If eveyone can take as much as they  want w would run out of under water life
3	seems a bit fishy to me
3	I am worried because people should not pulute because it is bad for the envoermnt.
3	the envionment needsto be top priority. way above recreation
3	removing whitebait freely woud damage the flora and fauna  balance in our water.we need to look after our oceans and the delicatebalance
3	this is a bad idea if whitebait are already struggling
3	that every one will take to much of it
3	it will be extinct and a disater to our animal species
3	Do it to feed whanau. Not for sport.
3	only take what your belly needs
3	people dont care about things outside thier home
3	If everyone takes as much as they want we will soon run out
3	I am worried about them because they could get extinct. I care about them.
3	if you catch too many itwill bebad
3	it needs a quota system in place and to besustainabgly mangaed
3	species cant replenish themselves if we take too many
3	the whitebait are not an endless resource if we only take a little  there will allways be some for everyone
3	I am woried because they all could die
3	i love whitebait especially fritters. but we need to look after the resource.
3	what did they ever do to us
3	it will run out and then their will beno more
3	i like watching little baby fish at the beach i don't  want all of them to die
3	witebait are getting caught too much and it could get extinct in the next few years
3	because we will loose an eco system
3	whitebait fishing should be managed and limited by counts
3	once they are gone we wont get a second chance
3	theres no respext for our animals that have struggling populations. only greed.
3	i wonder were my mum is i want her but i don't know were she is.
3	that whitebait shouldn't be caught as much as they are because they are being caught in too many at a time.
3	i think that people are greedy and will take too much
3	i  think that it is very bad for the fish because i am going to strave to death and i will stalk abd muder you. you better sleep with one eye open tonight
3	it is not good to feast on that
3	there is not enough and it will disappear
3	therell be nothing left if we take all we want
3	Taking as much of you want from anything is a bad idea!
3	with out some kind of regulation around how many whitebait are being cought then the likely hood of extiction isreallyhighand if anyone likes a good whitebait frittterlike me iwould be really sad if theywent extinct with someregulation it would mean the populatin would survive
3	i sthink this is because they will sloly get extinct
3	Dont undervalue primay consmers in an already compromised food web
3	because then all the whitebait species night go extict
3	ahh it seems youve met a terabbe terabbe person
3	if we carry on there wont be enough for future generations
3	they should be able to live
3	we are going to destroy our environment
3	overfishing is very bad for the environment
3	they are good and i dont like them
3	future generation might not be able taste or see it anymore
3	there's plenty of otherthings to eat
3	I THINK THAT NOBODY SHOULD CATCH FISH  BECAUSE THEY DISERVE TO LIVE AND BE INTHERE HABBITAT.
3	Slow down as they could one day become endangered.
3	i think everyone should fish the appropriate amount. CHUR
3	Many species are already  endangered due to the impact of human activities.
3	we dontwant  them to go extinct
3	i  think there should be a limit
3	theres not enough whiebait for that to be sustainable
3	because whitebait are endangered and we should protect them by regulating fishing
3	its  bad for the sea life
3	i think that he white bait would go extinc if we were allowed to take as many as we want from the ocean!
3	i think you shoudnt be allowed because then   there wount be any left
3	i think that we should stop because the fish are indanger andi wantto help
3	this is a Idea that will be dad
3	i think if peoplecatch too  many whitebait  there will be no white bait for any one else
3	I definitly dont want our oceans to die. But we need food; and sometimes its the only thing for someof us to get
3	NEEDS MANAGEMENT FOR SUSTAINABILITY OF THE ECO SYSTEM
3	i think no because it might get rid of that speses
3	fishys r scary naughty people trying tokill me or what i mean what has the world becoe nowadays back in my days u would neverdare to scare ne i was a very beuteful young lady dingbats haw very dareyou
3	we should be more clever about our impact on aquatic life
3	I think that it is pretty trash and sus
3	they are yum but it is sad tat they are dieing ad we dont want them tobe like rhe moaa past memorie that we  caused
3	###### is the ex wife of ### #### and im the   current wife ;)
3	i dont know if it will be healthy for them or if it wont be
3	worried that people will catch too many
3	i think i worry about over fishing
3	some people will overfish alot and because there are no rues they will be alowed to do this
3	because if you keep cathing whitebait then it will be extinct.
3	The catch shold be monitored With a quota system to allow the population to grow
3	It would endanger them and predators that feed on them
3	people alwaystakemore than they need. stop being greedy and we will be ok
3	i think  white bait should be a protected spiecis
3	because i dontlike that the babies arent going to grow up
3	waitbaits good but we cant keep at the rate itis without us losing it. however i know putting new rules in abut restricting acses will not go down well with a lot of poeple i kow
3	we should help the whit bait
3	theres too much room fir greed in a rule this broad
3	then there would be none left
3	i think because we need to keep the white bait for our children to see.
3	need to save for other generations
3	white bait are in trouble and its making me upset
3	because there could easily be a shortage and it could go extinct.
3	THAT WE EAT ALL THE WHITEBAIT
3	people eat to many of them
3	we need to protect our fish
3	there will be less whitebait for future generations. they will not be ale to experience them
3	if you keep hunting its gonna be extinct one day :(
3	weshould stickto lures tbh. like some is ok butnot heaps bc fish have feelings too and are good for the oceans ecosystem
3	the population will die if we catch to much witbae
3	i am worried about my parentsdriving bck to ###### but i am thabkful that they let me go to ##########
3	because then they will go extinct and thats not fair
3	because if the do they will damage the ecosystem
3	one day it will be gone and we will be hungry
3	over catchibg will change the ecology and disrupt food chain
3	We need to make sure that all our wildlife thrive and are safe. I dont think every body helping themselves to our whitebait is a wise idea.
3	i think that is irresponsibleto overfish.
3	it should not be sold to others you should only be abletocatch in a sustainable way for yourself.
3	because then wiggles won't hav enough
3	because the whitebait is going to be gone
3	We will kill all of the Whitebait and we will end up starving to death.
3	becuae we have nofish f we d that
3	not because it right now means right in the future
3	there should be a limit on whitebait farming in order to preserve the species
3	that this could cause  over fishing
3	...whitebait are the youbg of new zealand nativefish. if we all  catch as much as we want to some fsh species will become extinct and nobody wants that right? so we should continue ristrictions for the sake of our native fish secies!
3	if we could than they would go extinct and no more #####
3	need to be careful that we carefully manage the resource...i want my grandchildren and great grandchildren to be able to have a whitebait butty in 50 -100 years... so i need to stop eeateatingthem now
3	If everyone fishes as much as they want without any limits, then the species of whitebait will someday become extinct.
3	Whitebait are cool and should be protected.
3	what if we can not have any kai for the yunger and insted fisherman get all the food to sell just for the money
3	the whitebait population will get wiped out
3	we should make sure there are enough for everyone
3	becuase we will ru out of whitebait and they are at the bottom of the food chain
3	should be kind to others with the white bate we find
3	because its not the right thing to o not enough white bait
3	by 2025 its said that all ocens with have no fish
3	Because whitebait might be extinct soon
3	encourages overfishing which leads to a strain on the fishing population
3	Hi my name is #### and im behind on my child support payments. the whitebait helps heaps
3	because no one should be able to do whatever they want
3	im just in a constant state of worry. nothing to do with this.just anxiety innit. constantly on edge. all day everyday. its ok though. the waitbait talk to me and tell me everything will be ok. i trust the waitbait although im still worried about things. copletely irrelevent
3	people should be allowed to take a good amount but we need restrictions so there is enough to continue to grow and breed
3	There is risk of them becoming  extinct from this.
3	people are greedy and take more than they need
3	Bio divesity is important. Native animals should be preserved
3	i te mimiti haere o nga inanga.
3	seems unsastainable given population increases combined with a lack of restriction
3	we need to look after our wildlife
3	Idk what this is im only three
3	we are going to loose thisfish if we dont help there natural numbers
3	it is depleting the future generations of dlt breding tock
3	I think we will run out
3	that if evevryone takes too much stock will never recover
3	there should be a limit to how muchwhitebait ucan catch :/
3	if we eat all the whitebait there will be none left for the animals
3	we need to manage our stocks or there'll be no more whitebait
3	if this idea does happen then the white bait population will most likely go extinct
3	i am worried because they are endangderd
3	care should be taken to restore habitat and replenish this taonga, but it should be balanced with allowing cultural harvest if rhui has not been set by iwi 
3	that thy might extinc wich would be bad even if there are so many now thay can still die out ofer time
3	People should be allowed to catch whitebait... but not so many that they wipe out the entire speicies.
3	over fishing. some people can catch more than their share
3	greedy need to maintain te ecosystem
3	i think it sould be fished in moderation
3	because it would be extinct if it was allowed
3	we should all be able to fish forever
3	if everyone was allowed as much as they wanted would they leave enough for the future generations .I dont think so
3	Species should be protected whilst sustaining cultural customs
3	we need to save our sea creatures
3	thats a last century selfish idea i thought was on the wain.
3	how do we preventet over fishing and extinction likeso many other specie?
3	that taking too much of a limited resurce has significant negative consequences
3	there wont be any left to reproduce
3	because then there woodnt be much lseft
3	as over fishing may kead to extinction
3	i think that a lot of people will overfish as soon as the restrictions arelifted.they will go extinct
3	we dont want them to go extinct so there should be a limite
3	i think there needs to be a certain nmber of waitbait you can catch so there is less dnager of  extinsion and we can all share  YUM
3	the whitebait fisheries is under enough pressure from habitate degredation and loss plus climate change challanges. let the whitebait population recover to pre european levels
3	This would be fine  if  people only took what  they needed. However - people  often take more than they need -wasting resources and depleting supply for others.
3	i thik that if people were allowed as much as theywant they would abuse it
3	it would be another sad loss
3	ovrfishing can happen. thatcan be detrimental to its ecosystems
3	if we dont limit the amount of fish we catch there will be none left
3	because we should not  take things if they are already in trouble
3	they need to be protected and only fished at certain times
3	They may end up running out.
3	beccause ventuually there wiill be nne lef
3	BECAUSE IT WILL LEAD TO OVER-FISHING CAUSING THEANIMAL TO GO EXTINICT
3	i dont actually know about fishing so....
3	there shouldbelimits and personal consumption only
3	that if everyone can catch as much as they want that means there will not be enough for other people. Also there will NOT be enough Whitebati in the world.
3	You should ban commercial fishing  the average man with hisnet at the beach isnt the problem.
3	We can't trust people will catch just enough for the right reasons
3	quang takes it up the ass
3	I love whitebait so much i am willing to sacrifice limiting my consunption to encourage repopulation of the species to ensure they dont become extinct. seems only logical!
3	that people should not take more thn they need
3	it could go extinct. thats not ok
3	I think that they should only be allowed to catch a certain amount because there will be none for other people to catch.               Also because in the end there will be none at all and that is never a good sign!
3	I am worried about it as if everyone could catch as much as they wanted they would go exctinct and generations to come would not be able to enjoy them.
3	i am very worried because the fish might go extinct
3	they shuld not be abe to
3	people are really greddy im mad
3	there needs t be aimit so they have a chance at recovery abd renewal
3	i think this idea will make them xtinct
3	bcause we need white bait fish to see
3	yumm yummy childen in my tummy
3	worried means that your worried for someone
3	we should only take what we need
3	Its all well and good if there are plenty of species reproducing but they aren't therefore it is not sustainable to have people catching as many as they want
3	that there should be a limit because whitebait is precious and if people keep fishing them there willbe less for future genertions
3	i think there should be a limit on all fishng in nz.
3	I think that white bait are yummy but if we were allowed to catch as much as we wanted there would be none left.
3	The tragedy of the commons has been played out too many times. While some people are responsible and will only take what they need in a sustainable way it doesn't work well as a long term management strategy. We need to look after whitebait now so that they last into the future.
3	cuz we will egstinkt them all
3	you should not cach to much
3	IF EVERYONE CATCHES IT THERE WILL BE NONE LEFT
3	this is a bad idea because if everyone can just take as much as they want there may not be any left oneday.
3	whitebait are scarce and need to be protected.
3	if we keep going at this rate the fish will become extinct.we need to change our behaviour now.
3	white baitewill become extinc soon if everyone has as many as they want
3	it is unmonitored and removing  a species at its most juvenille stage in life... we wont see the damage for a generation. Our methods of fishing are far too advanced for wid animals to  stand a chance.
3	because  people like us have been hurting them
3	theres not alot of whitebait around to consume as much as we like. if we are going to harvest for a mean feed we should be returning such wealth to the habitat and living enviroment of whitebaitwhitebait
3	i dnt wabt any fish to di e  said sans from undrtale
3	the question should  be if we want those who come after us to be able to know/see whitebait
3	bc they will go extinct which will ruin the ecosystem and play a significant role in climmate change and the death of the planet
3	what makes us mre important than other specis. So why make it worse when we have the power to help .
3	endandered species should limit  catch or applya quota
3	that they should be looked after just like every other species
3	because there will be none left
3	natural resources should be cosumed moderately
3	I think all will be gone
3	it would lead to over fishing
3	overfishing leading to severe drops in population and unstastainability
3	the fish would not be able to survive
3	we shouldlimit what we take and make this resourse sustainable
3	beacause theres not much left of them
3	bc ppl will take too muc
3	because we already have so many extinct species and catching mre than you need is just a waste
3	such vulnerable species need to be protected
3	bc we dontknow what will happen to them
3	because taking more then you need is rude and could imact its life force
3	too much fishing causes a break in the food chain
3	ithinktherenight not be enough and they mightdie
3	i really am not worried at all i don't care and i hope all of the white bait die
3	fishing sould be banned and we eat more veges
3	we need to protect our resources for future geneations
3	that we shouldnt fish white bait at all because it is dicusting
3	.I think tht this is not a sustainable method to fishing and can cuse an extinction of species. According to the statistics overfishing is on of the main reasons that whitebait are becoming endangered with the probable risk of extinction
3	population is decreasig toofast with no time torecover
3	because people will taketoo much and disrupt balance
3	theyshould stop otherwise the sea wont be ballenced anymore
3	to many will be caught at once
3	there might not enough abd we could endanger them
3	Because there might not  be enough
3	whitebait numbers are dcresing..if we dont take care of all our species wewill beeft with nothing.
3	it can have a huge impact for the future
3	im worried because fish are just like us humans they shouldnt have to get killed for us to eat there should be a limit on how long you can fish for so not many can get killed :)
4	well if everyone catchs however many they want there will be no fish for future generations
4	we need to protect this special resource
4	they are already endandered thats dumb af bro
4	Threatened species should not be dinner!!
4	its fundamentally wrong to haveto buy a trout licence and not whitebait  . why protect trout for tourism and allow free acess to whitebait? The dollar wins again.
4	too much damage to the ecosystem
4	there seems to be a deeply selfish sense of entitlement that whitebaiters hae an inalienable right to pillage regardless of impact on sustaibability and future generations.
4	becus etheyare still fis theyare not on this plaetjust tobe our kai thissaystat humans are to greedy
4	everytging should be done in moderation and thought.
4	we cnt trust individuals tothink of thelong term orig picture.
4	we need baby eels to make more eels.
4	it shows naivety. all things must b balanced to enable long term enjoyment
4	bcause i just want to ok
4	need sustainable stocks for future generations. delicious but fragile
4	because people are being selfish abd stupid about itand all they care about is money
4	it is mad and selfish to over take from nature by human greedyness
4	we should look after the enviormen moe
4	that we will eventaly kill out all our animals at the rate were going ifthere are rules put in place about it then we can still do it wthout overdoing it and wont kill out another speices or hurt or earth more
4	i dont think we should catch as much as we want because we have other food sources like plants and veg that are sustainable
4	because the whitebait  will go instected
4	overfishing leads to extinction which also devasting nz stream and freshwater ecosystems
4	too much greed and selfish ideologies create fake reasoning
4	all food sources should be regulated for sustainability
4	we should protect our whitebait for future generations to enjoy
4	people have become selfish abd feel as if thryhae a right to it
4	because it gets them away from their mum
4	itshould be limited sofish haveabetter chanceto grow
4	I Belive we should limit peoples catch so we can preserve our fishing ability
4	we need to allow this species recover
4	i support sustainable levels of kai gatheing
4	becuse you dont get to overfish everything
4	It is immoral to decimate the population of our young native fish to make some mediocre tasting fritters. Get a fishing rod and go catch an actual fish.
4	Because if we keep fishing whitebat without regard they will go exstintict and n ne will be able to eat them again
4	there wont be any left soon
4	humans are no more important than other species on the planet and we must respect all forms of life
4	unsustainble. why native whitebait but not native birds. double standards.
4	Fishing is one of numerous pressures on our precious and threatened freshwater fish species...and it's one we should control through tighter rules - particularly in the commercial catch.
4	over fishing leads to extintion of the sea life whichleads to entintion of ld animals and a unbalanced food chain
4	you wouldnt eat a kiwi. Theyre endangered
4	if people catch too much then they will go extint
4	over fishing will result in long term harm and loss of species and diversity
4	this is bad for the future fish stocks
4	because they have the audacity to be that selfish
4	becose my little brother has destrakd me
4	learn from past mistakes. you cant bring species back from extincion.
4	they put so much effrt into making babies and then get culled
4	tangata whenua have been  disenfranchised which has separated us from our hapu and role as kaitiaki. our waterways need protection
4	its an outdated practice that is endandering our native fish species.
4	because then there wnt be alot of it
4	idont thubk we sshould have to eat animals
4	you should have a limit on how many whitebait you catch so that there's enough for everyone.
4	becouse it is food for other sea creatures
4	they are very imorntant to the inviroment
4	As the population   ofNZ has increased then so have the number of Whitebaiters.  They now have more sofisticated camper vans with freezers etc.  I THINK EVERY LEAP YEAR SHOULD BE A WHITEBAIT FREE YEAR.  Also shorten the season for remaining years...
4	we are killing our natural environment. it is not just killing the witebait but also other fish and creatures caught too
4	Because whitebait are living animals just like us and they have feelings too. How would you like it if someone just cameup to you and killed you and all of your friends and ate you? Very happy Iguess
4	sustainably fished whitebait are the cause for this we arenot fishing in a way that ensures whitebait for the future.
4	they definitly should not. theyshouldnt vbecauhtat all
4	it is selfish and unnecessary. moderation to save the planet
4	you are stupud #### you killed me
4	that white bait should be limted on how long you should fish for and how many you can have
4	people will be greedy and take too much and they will go extinct because it isnt sustainable. then there wont be any for anyone. This will damage the delicate ecosystem making other animals go extict as well. :(
4	!Birds should be free not captiored. Why do people like captioring birds so much? Birds belong in the wild!NO CAPTIORING BIRDS THAT SHOULD BE ILLIGLE SINCE PEOPLE LOVECAPTIORING BIRDS SO MUCH!
4	we should leave them to grow into fish
4	there should be a limit so population can increase recover and stay strong and i am vegetarian so do not think you need to eat them
4	there should be a limit on all wildlife catch. it is selfish to plunder limited resources for so many reaysons. whitebait fishing should be halted and an effort made to restore the species.
4	becuse if you tke them all therewill be no more left
4	#### is so mean and a cgddh
4	We always take advantage of the things we enjoy. The mre we catch the less that we can enjo because we will kill them alllllll
4	becores if thathappns white bait are goibg to e in truble
4	the ecosystem needs to be kept in balannce
4	they should be ableto lives without worrying that they will die.
4	they are not an unlimited resource
4	we will destroy our native fish
4	there would end up havibg none left
4	Everyone who went for excited or hopeful probably have like 3 brain cells
4	Protecting species against endangerment should be more important than increasing our availabe menus...
4	cos the giant suid is gone
4	i want children in the future to see our native fish
4	im aggrivated let the fish live darls
4	we need to look after them
4	bullshit save some for the rest of us
4	because they need to have a life as well. they are living animals just like us.
4	Khore nga kai inaianei engari tino kino tena whkro inaianei.
4	we do not need sea food to survive. we should avoid fishing and allow the seas to regenerate and thrive. over fishing harms the planet which is our home
4	they will die out you idiots
4	People shouldnt eat living things anyway
4	its ridiculous its still allowed when it so obvious
4	whitebait are the  young of several species of threatened  native fish
4	we should protect them we can live withouteating them for a while
4	no. there should be almt to everything
4	i think that this is a bad idea because they will becme exstict
4	50 lives for a fritter innit
4	there is not many whitebait left
4	since whitebait are at risk and threatened with extinction we shouldnt eat them.
4	i like whitebait in my tum tum.
4	murdering animals and is not fair
4	they need protecting and we have no need toeatthem
4	whitebait are baby fish. its not sustainable
4	People care more about their tastebuds than the planet
4	we are eating baby native fish
4	the trout will go die out  so no wite bate
4	you would eat all waitbait NONO
4	whitebait comprise endangered nz fish species and should have greater protection
4	ITS WRONG TO DO THIS AS SO MANY FISH SPECIES ARE BECOMING EXTINCT
4	Driving animal species to extinction is wrong.
4	i hate the idea ofpeople killing fish they are just like humans
4	people eat millions of these native fish before they have had a chance to grow. no wonder they are going extinct
4	more trematoads in the rivers plaes
4	this is wrong. we need to protect our resources for future generations
4	that it shouldnt be aloud because its verysacred
4	they maintain the concentration i roto i tatou moana
4	Leave the poor little fish alone! Their alreadyoib extinct!
4	too much over fishing. stop. only take what you need
4	because  we gitta potect our species
4	sometimes people have to give up things for the good of all
4	i am angry because i think people are using to much witebait
4	in moderation You dont take more than you need
4	we need to look after our planet more
4	People dont realise how quickly we are losing animals due to fishing hunting etc.
4	bc they are a living  thing just like us would u like it if they done that to u no so why do it to then
4	everyone or everything has a life or to exept there dream
4	its sillyto hunt a species to extinction just because we think its tasty
4	Respect for the commons means respecting the need for conservation. Taking what one needs; not what one wants.
4	This is a position I find difficult to understand. It is pure greed
4	there should be a limited amount or quotas to avoid overfishig
4	biannually.  every second year to build numbers
4	waitbait are native species and shoud be protected to ensure a viable future of our fish and natural water habitats
4	having no limits on harvesting means greed and possible extinction. perserve for generations to come.
4	i think it should have limits and only  limited commercial sale
4	I do believe there should be a quota
4	IT is a precious resource that should be protected tosomeextent
4	you should nt stuff animals beacsue they have famileysand you stink
4	Need to be protected so that they can grow up andreplenish populations
4	we shouldnt be overfishing. were killing them
4	we need to protect whtebait !!!!!  theyre fukylittlecute fellas
4	Without awareness of how everything is connected we are destroying our beautiful ecosystem
4	i hate thefact thatyou can just stuff animals
4	i thing they should be only court for recreation
4	endangered native species should be protected
4	that mans very soon there would be no more whitebait
4	fishing is bad for the enviroment. ITS KILLING THE OCEAN
4	whitebait providecriticalfodsourcefor ither members of the sea. humans dontneed to eat everyones food
4	Because they are native and deserve to live their life and not live in hiding. They should  be able to live freely justlike us humans do.
4	I think we need to balance personal freedoms with caringfor the planet and the species on it
4	it is a stupd idea we shoulnt do it
4	all the whitebait will be gone
4	killing sentient beings is wrong you murdering nazis
4	i put it in maori opps
4	this will result in no whitebait
4	we should preserve and conserve some people are greedy
4	not enough fish aye. my mate ##### saidhe gottons last time but then #### caught too mch and ##### couldnt get mre
4	because the fish will be extingct
4	fuck you for killinh the fish
4	much as i like whitebait the resource has to be managed with no exceptions
4	if these fish are in trouble we shoud not keep fishing them without control. let's  fish something else. there is plenty of alternatives available
4	we need to conserve their numbers to enure the popolation in the future
4	there are already too many species that are extinct because of that type of behaviour
4	Not enough whitebait make it to adulthood
4	ALL THESES RANDOM PEOPLE COMING TO NZ AND STEALING ALL THE KAI MOANA.. FFS!!
4	native inland fish speces wil be extinct soon
4	it is very short sighted and shows ignorance of the fragility of nature
4	be nice to the white bait. it tastes to good to miss
4	damag to atie ecosystems and preventin f future generations enjoying our wildlife
4	its not fair. whitebait have feelings to
4	We need to preserve this taonga for those who come after us 
4	how will fish populations recover if we keep eating all the babies
4	WE ONLY HAVE LIMITED RESOURCE SO WE SHOULD ONLY TAKE WHAT WE NEED.
4	humans are  damaging our eco system stop being greedy. every species has a purpose
4	Because thats greedy. we should only ever fish for a meal. Not for as much as you WANT
4	WE ARE OVER FISHING AND WLL RUN WHITE BAIT INTOEXTINCTION. we cannot goon like this
4	because they made this thing that makes pepole know how we are feeling
4	because its anonrenewable resource that we need to take care of for thefu ture
4	that is stupidthere should be limtes
4	we should leave the baby fish and restore our awa
4	because  there wont be  any left soon
4	white bait should be left alone
4	because i dont want anyone to eat fish it s mean and selfish
4	because white bait have as much right to live as we do and shoulnt go extnct just for us
4	with no quota we are reducing are stocks. people also sell whitebait cash only with little funds given back to nz
4	my previous response i spelt it waitbait  instead of whitebait. although i am a grown man i am also dyslexic and have simply never been fishing in my life and even if i had why would i need to spell it unless keeping a tally or something. not everything is about competition gary
4	##### should come back if youre readibg this plese xomc baxk i sewear im sorry it was an acidebt i just dropped he baby
4	white bait are animal what if white bait  caught you
4	we have other foodsources we can use
4	these  species are indangered we shuld atleast put a rahui on itto help them grow but a  rahui as only a minimum
4	all the whitebait will eventually die!
4	show some moderation. fatty. or else there aint gonna be anymore to stuff your face with. fool.
4	They are going to be extinct soon.
4	people are selfish and will hunt another species to extinction
4	fishing needs to be truly sustainable to protect our oceans and stop global warming
4	i think that whitebait fishing should have restrictions. otherwise whitebaitwould go extinct
4	that they shouldlet them reprouduce before they fish for more
4	dafishiesneed to live so no more extinct
4	we need to future proof our fisheries
4	WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO LIVE THERE OWN LIVES
4	We have become too greedy. It should be regulated. We need to let our oceans recover!
4	endangered spieces should not be exploited for profit with no conservation plan
4	people are greedy and take more than they nee
4	there are other things to eat
4	this resource requires management to avoid a tragedy of the commons situation. our government needs to be a driving force for protection.
4	i will tell yourparents i was enjoing my soap opeara
4	becase it is herting the ocean.
4	me tiaki i taua tonga hei aha te hiakai o te tangata
4	we need corect managment of these taonga species before  we think about harvesting them. a rahui should be in place.
4	we should not take what we wantonly what we really need
4	because of the assumption we deserve tge right to pilage natural resources
4	its shortsighted to fish any species without measures. no species is immue to overfishing. we should protect our marine environments not raid them
4	this is bad because they are living animals!
4	fritters arent delicious enough to justify extinction
4	i am very angry. my son ####### has missed soccer practice
4	because animas will fade away andit will brgour ecosystem ot of balance
4	because theyre overfished and are in danger of becoming extinct
4	whitebait wont have a chance to live
4	i think as white bait is getting rarer we need watch how much we are taking from the sea
4	peopleshould let the baby natives grow
4	we should have  current plan that eliminates the chance of extinction completely
4	our sea/water life is taken for granted
4	that i am i am i am iam egg bts
4	Its because I don't want them to go exstinct
4	we need now more hen ever to safeguard our future abd the oceans are our futre
4	we need to  after thewhite bait otherwise wise there will be no more left for later generations
4	should alway be a cap. sorry emilia
4	because in ###### we did a big thingabout why no
4	so that future generations canenjoy whitebait and preserve traditional food sources.
4	there shud be a limt because otherwise it willnot beable to repopulate
4	people take much more than theyneed for personal use
4	because i like whitebit abd it will be all gn
4	we need to protect our taonga
4	why kill them all . be a good  ancestor
4	I THINK ABOUT KFC BECAUSE I AM GAY
4	because we need limitaions to how much and to let the fish be
4	I THINK WE SHOUID BE ANGRY
4	It's so short sighted and unsustainable.
4	i think if everyone got as many as they want there would be none left
4	it will wipe out the fish
4	if we dont stop catching fish then we wont have anymore. this is part of climate change and im truly hopeful that everyone takes action soon.
4	uh white bait are endangered and im gonna call the manager
4	it is over fishing and it will wipe them allout
4	those species are protected so they should not be sold for profit
4	we shouldnt disrupt the jueniles in a life cycle
4	restrictions must be putinto place to ensure that we will have our inanga in the future
4	it is causing a bad impact on the enviroment
4	we areover fishing and causing harm to whole ocean ecosystem. eat your greens.
4	ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE ALLOWED TO BE KILLED???????!!!!!!!!
4	we dont need to eat animals
4	white bait are in trouble and its making me upset
4	i think it is wrong and unfair
4	we will endanger species through over fishing
4	humans need to change theway we live becausewe arekilling species
4	I'm very angry with you guys.
4	they need a chanc to reproduce
4	i live on the awa and people always take everything they can without any regard for the future
4	over fishing is a massive issue that is now facing the world. we need to act now.
4	because ##### makes me feel that way the hua
4	we need to limit fishing. Be willing to pay a bit more for our fish in exchange to a healthier ocean. We are responsible for our planet.
4	a recipe for disaster...people are greedy
4	people desirve a fair share of whitebait
4	because people are mean to everything including fish ....
4	over explortation of our natural resourses
4	eventuley we will have none left so sad and angrey
4	the survival and wellbeing of the animal should come first before us eating them. we dont need them to survive
4	WE SHOULD NOT BE HURTING ANIMALS FOR OUR OWN FOOD AND ENJOYMENT
4	Protecting our native species against culling and extinction is vital to maintaining a healthy level of biodiversity to keep our ecosystems functioning normally.
4	i thik my sister is on crack
4	Because over fishing is a big problem. For example if you fishout a lot of the white bait you are taking away food from larger fish and could unbalance the food chain and therefore cripple the ecosystem
4	catch should be heavily restrited or bannedin total
4	We are just killing our taonga to extinction
4	i think we should be mindfull of where we are whonweare and whatwedo
4	native species to new zealand. taonga to maori. we need a licence to catch trout which are introduced but not for our whitebait? regulations needed right now not implemented over two years
4	i think that people should sart to leave fish alone
4	there should be no over consumption of any animal and whitebait fishing should be sustainable
4	because we need to take careof our streams
4	Na te mea me tokoiti noiho rtou e toi ana
4	people are too greedy with them
4	just what!? whitebait are already in trouble and you are saying we should let everyone just catch as many as they want!? no just no.
4	limit it so we can all enjoyit
4	The baby fish are the basis of a functioning ecosystem. When we take so many for our kai the ecosystem is damaged
4	fish  are a finite resource which are being sapped by  human greed.  we are  destroying our planet
4	because the more they catch the less mouths to feed
4	we have finite amounts of whitebait so we cant abuse it or it will vanish
4	We have exploited our resources for too long.
4	cause they r decllining innumbers rapidly and im pretty sure they r endangered
4	Because I dont want them to go extenkt
4	we need to restore the ecosystem
4	endangered species should be protected so or wildlife an recover and thrive
4	because it dosent make sence do you want to live or die
4	ths upsets me we diffently can do much better to halp our native speacies
4	nobody should have full access to as much kaimoana as they want
4	now becoming endangered due to habitat loss and over fishing
4	my grandkids wont be able to eat delicious whitebait patties
4	i think we should not because they might get extinged if every one caches them and we are trieng to make less creatures die like that. that is my opinion
4	cuus i see alot of fat people
4	where im from ######## over the yaers white bait have decressed draculily
4	4  of the 6 whitebait species are threatened or at risk of extinction
4	i think that it is a  bad idea andit is mean so i am mad
4	if pople are allowed to catch as much whitebut asthey ant theywill go extinct
4	they are importan for the ecsysystem
4	becaus i have to gotony dads
4	Whitebait is a very important part of New Zealand. It would be a shame for it to go extinct.
4	i dont like the smellof fish
4	we need to preserve so there some for future generations
4	I am angrybecause that whitebait are living animals too!!
4	modern capitalism means we have lost touch with papatuanuku. if we continue to take it must be sustainable
4	LEAVE THE FUCKING THINGS ALONG FULL STOP.
4	We should be caretakers of our environment not just takers.
4	I THINK IT WILL BE SCARY
4	Where is the C?NS?RV?T¦?N ®n tht stt?m?nt. HORRENDOUS  concept
4	because if we kill all the wightbait we are destroing a type of livibg creature
4	should only catch 500grams a family
4	humans cant stop until itstoo late.
4	they should have the same protection other native species have
4	i think gay pepole shouldbe killed for fun they have no rights
4	because they are animals and we shoundnt eat animals. thst is disgusting. or do you want to geteatibg by someone? no?well.ths is your answer. hae a nice ddy abd thibgabut yur food behavier
4	we take take from nature without thought for the future
4	because then there will be no fish for the planet and the world will be coverd in rubbish
4	because they would grow intobig fish that would feed so many more people
4	there should be limits. we can not lose our resource for good
4	that we have made to many animals extent
4	i dont fish them so idk. cool exhibit tho
4	i think there should be sticter limts
4	I thinkthat if everyone take whitebait then they will become extinct. They should at least be able to have babies.
4	that it isoverfishing and killing to many
4	we have a responsibility to our aquatic species. we dont need lots.
4	Ive always been angry about the fact that us humans have been eating fish or meat and beng happy while all the animals and creatures out there are constantly being hunted down for decades. I want this to stop!
4	We are respinsiblefor the species in our care- regardless of how tasty we think they are!
4	We should be more careful and cautious
4	it is completely unsustainable. People who believe this are unaware of the impact and need educating
4	ths comment shows dssrespect for the sustainabiity of our natural environment
4	its a native species under extreme treat
4	this is li. i on belive in that cjhgsgfadfhhh cujjsjassjaahffy kcuf ffo
4	We have no right. We are obligated to preserve natural life but we are just invasive
4	as more and more animals dont get food they die
4	we should not be doing this
4	whitebait want to live  dont be speciesist
4	i think its ridiculous that there are strict controls on introduced predator fish and very little control on catching whitebait
4	Populations wll be exploited until extinction
4	i think people should be limited
4	becaus people dont understandthey cnt have everythibg thywant
4	All fish should be limted to how long you can fish for and how many fish you can have if you sell fish the amount you can have can be extended and for normal everyday people less lets keep the oceans clear
4	it will be to hard to even tried  to cach one in a net
4	we need to conserve our native species
4	that im  angry becuz no reasons
4	White bait are  a endangered species and should be protected!
4	no oneis entitled to the natural resources of our countires rivers
4	the current political state of serbia is atrocious
4	fish should be able to  live
4	MY ITHEC THET WE TSED NOT E B
4	There is allredy a shrinking population.This could drive them to extinction
4	i believe like most things humans do we overdo  everything.
4	they are endangered and are partof keeping our steams andrivers healthy
4	humans do not need abundant amounts of whitebate... or any other sea foods or animals. that is just  pure greed.
4	whitebait are the young we need to grow our native fish species
4	leave some for the next persn
4	we need to stop being greedy end of
4	i think we must thnk about sustainable harvest for the present and future. no room for more greed. leave that in the past
4	bcaus they are catching other ebdangered fresh water secies at the same tim
4	it is bad for the ecosystem.
4	no one should be allowed to take as much asthey wont . greed and humans being selfish  is not appripriste now .save the whitebait
4	that there should be a limit
4	there wont b any left evenually
4	people should not be able to catch a lot of the same fish
4	preserving native ecology is incresngly more important as global warming causes more environmental decline; still tastes good though
4	theytaste raellybad abd marnite is gross
4	they arein decline so should b
4	whitebait are small species of fish that in months time would be deemed to small to take even 1. so how are we allowed to take them by the millions while they are smaller than that?
4	ummm isnt it bad enough that weve destroyed mostof their ecosystem?! why do we have to kill them? :(
4	my father left me and i am taking it out on whitebait farmers
4	i dont like it when people have rights
4	all animals help protect the enviroment becase we are destroying it. if we catch as many white bait as we want then we will be putting even more of a death sentenc on the world then we already have.
4	cause every one is going to be fat
4	unsustainable need to keep a balanced ecosystem for populations to thrive in the future
4	Men should respect the environment and allow it to flowrish once again.
4	save the fish and our planet
4	we should be protecting our native fish. instead of supporting fish and games attempt to protect salmon and trout
4	angry means  your mad at someone
4	ifwe want ourfuturerotected we need to actnow
4	humans should not be greey dumbos
4	should be a limit and no sales allowed
4	because we wont have any fish left in the sea soon so we schould stop fishing
4	we need to give the species respect and time to replenish
4	there should be limits and there should be more monitoring to ensure people arent filling their fridge.
4	they are at risk of becoming exctinct
4	they dont deserve to go extinct
4	uh whitebait are endangered and its making me upset
4	you breed greed and a dont care for anyone else atitude PLUS destroy natures blnce and sustainability for the future
4	commercial fishing is the number one killer of our oceans. proect our moana for future generatons
4	THEY WILL GO EXTINCT IF WE KILL THEM ALL!!!
4	we need to let our native fish grow to adulthood to allow breeding in order to keep the species alive
4	we should be  angry  cvfvgsfgvsvffsfcfcffccfddsfccfsdsdccfcsfcsccfccfdccfdccfcdcfdcfdcccfcdfccxffcxfcdfccccfcfcfcccdcsfcsfccfcfsscffrsfcfssfcsfcscfsfcsfcsfsgvgvsvggvsfrccfcrf fcrc?x????y?f?hw?gghgw?hgfwcrwfrcrwcwdhdxcdd cdcddcdc cdc dcd ddcdcdcc cddcdddc c
4	we are not entitled to take greediy from nature
4	that  lots shoud be left in the streams
4	its ignorant and entitled to hunt to extinction!
4	it is extemely harmul to endangered species
4	:its a big fat no from me. i'm not even a teen yet and i know that they are endangered. why would you suggest to hunt them even more? its called overfishing you know?  i just don't like it at all.yes whitebait are tasty but do you want them to become extinct?!  sorry for the rant
4	witebaid will go extinct if we catch all/too much
4	i dont understand why you dont care
4	give it a break like lockdown so it can replenish itself
4	They wont survive. We have quota on other seafood but why not whitebait? Sustainable fishing can be implemented and still allow everyone for enough
4	they are too endangered. keep catching whitebait equals nomore whutebait in the future. you decide what the future looks like. theydont even taste like anything but egg.
4	because people need to be more carful
4	because i cant tell you its a secret
4	sustainability is more important than whitebait patties
4	do you wanna lose another species?
4	we need to let them grow up bred
4	tis pisses ne orf v bish
4	I think its badbeacuase therewill be  non left and they need fish forthe ecosystem.
4	we should protect our fish species
4	this mindset cannt be sustained. will be takibg away from future generations
4	whitebait might be tasty but not when this satistic means there wont be any in the future. PLEASE stop fishing now. SelFISH  people!
4	it is terrible. We are harming native fish
4	no we neede to preserve our stocks for the future
4	Quota needs to be set to protect it from being wiped out.
4	Individual people aren't entitled to it just because they want it
4	too much disregard fr the natives here
4	rape of a resource tht is not really known in quantity
4	we have damaged enough as it is.
4	it's just a dumb fish that is too small to eat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ):(
4	ilove evry fish andi dont want to hurt them
4	GKVHHCNX CCB HVMVKJBKC  G G¦hklkY¦? ?L
4	i think that we will turn greedy
4	people need to remember that if they take too much there will not be any whitebait around in the future to enjoy. sustainability.
4	i will have no nore food ad that nakes me mad     VERY MAD
4	it will pset the diversityof our waterways which needs o be protected
4	mad becous something bad happend to them
4	they shoud be allowwed to matrue
4	its common sense if numbers are falling to stop whitebait fishing
4	We know that the species are in danger. We know that if there arent restrictions they will become critical. It just  seems sensless that we would catch then to extinction and not do anything about it.
4	white bait is no longer plentiful
4	i think thats dumb becauseits not sustainable and eventually some speciescan go extint pus thefishers arnent eve eating some of the fish theycatch
4	if we take us much as we want there wont be any left
4	i dont like it cause it sad
4	i think that should be allowed peiodtttttt
4	PEOPLE SHOULD RESPECT ANDTAKEONLY WHATBIS SUSTAINABLE . WHAT IS SUSTAINABE CAN CHANGE AND RULESMAY NEED TO BE ADAPTED YER TO YEAR
4	the ocean does not belong to us. we need to respect it and its inhabitants
4	we need to do better. it's selfish to take too much and there needs to be a limit
4	people are greedy andpillage the fish
4	becauseifeveryone has as much as they want there wont be any left.
4	i think people should not catch whitebait because it ruins our sea life. q
4	i tink humans dontknow when to stop. put alimit!!!!!!!
4	Think past your own temporary enjoyment
4	we need to look after our precious taonga sothey survive for the future and i wish people would stop fishing for a while until they  recover
4	every one should get a decant amount
4	whitebait are precious baby fish not tobe eaten
4	anyone who thinks this has no consideration for nature or the future
4	i feel as if our moana has suffered enough already from overfishing
4	no u are hurt the fish so no
4	uh white bait is getting endangered
4	whitebaiting is unnecessary and kills our fish stocks
4	we are killing off native fish by eating te spwn
4	THERE SHOULD BE LIMITS ON ANOUNTS CAUGHT
4	they did surgery on a grape
4	i think this is not a good idear beacause then they might get exteced. my idear is that every one only catch twenty a day
4	if everyone was allowed to catch as much whitebait as they  wanted eventually there would be none left which is worse than having a limit to how much we catch
4	i think we are over fighing with no regard to the future
4	catch as much not as needed is greed
4	i thibk we need to protect and respect our environment.
4	we should leave some so they can breed and make more whitebait
4	we should learn from the past.or theyll be none left for the future
4	inanga (whitebait) have been overfished inthe days before pakeha inanga were fished sustainably so there were always inanga for future generations.
4	Covid-19 is killing us all. WE MUST KILL THE VIRUS AND SAVE NEW ZEALAND
4	theres plenty of other food to eat!!!
4	THATTHE FISHIES ARE TOO SMALL LET THEM DIE OTHERWIE UWILLDIE
4	That we shoulden't be allowed tofish as much as we want because they will die out and we ont be able to save them easily. That is because with the new rules people will be used to fishing whitebait as much a they want.
4	you shouldnt catch whitebait at all
4	this is sellfish. unresonable and not sustainable. fishing should be illegal. such as dairy and meat farms.
4	we do not need to eat them plenty of plant food available
4	its ridiculous to take as much as you want from any ntural envirnment.  take only what you need and lave the rest to multiply
4	cose sesons for next four years
4	they are the young of several endemic threatened fish species and need their population to recover
4	We have to ensure our future generations will be able to enjoy. Over fishing will deplete this valueable resource
4	we need to stop whitebait fishing for nowso future generations can enjoy it
4	ALL THERE PEOPLE COMING HERE FROM OTHER PLACES AND CATCHING TOO MANY FFS!!!!
4	they are  good but if you take to much there wont be any left for our kids
4	human impact needs to be monitered
4	it will wipe them out forever
4	moderation and sustainability is so important butso greatly disrespected
4	NO ONE SHOULD HUNT ANYTHIBG EVER AGAIN HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
4	you need nly have enough for a feed  no selling
4	uhhhh ummmm uhm uhh uhhhh uhhhh hhh uhhhh cause i uhhhm uhhummm um uuuuuuuuuuummm uhmmmm uhmmmmmm um
4	because i dont like ##### he gay and i bet him in basketball lol hes just salty i won HAHAHA NIGG
4	theyre in trouble. heaps of greedy peopl.
4	there will be none left if #### eats them all
4	baby fish. no chance to reproduce
4	they are all in danger of becoming extinct. needs to be sustainable
4	none will srvive  to breed. we are too greedy. plus the water quality is decreasing so further challenges the fish
4	i think whitebaiting should be stoped
4	I think it would be horrible if the fish went extinct so NO
4	people shpuld only take enough for a feed
4	its not a good idea because there wont be any left for the grandchildren
4	our ecosystem is mistreated enough already. leave them alone
4	we are fishing the likes of tuna and cod at a rate that these might one day soon become extinct. the same will happen to whitebait. " there's plenty of fish in the sea" - till there's not.
4	it is not okey the fish well get exstinst and it well be bad
4	we should only be able to catch as much as allows the whitebait population to continue to thrive
4	because they are in danger because of humans
4	to be able to sell without any quota is madness
4	to much whitebate gone means no healthy rivers and streams
4	this is no a good idea that would be a rellay stupid
4	it is bringing a large number of fish species closer to extinction.
4	Greed takes over then its gone
4	I suppose it is not good.
4	too much over fishing in our waters and rivers
4	i think that tohave a 'take as much as youlike' attitud is irresponsible! It separates us from a sense of connection with the environment which is NOT unlimited!!
4	THE BENGES WILL STRIVE AGENST CATS
4	it shouldn't be allowed. replenish the stocks. ban fishing for a few years.
4	bc den not alot in the future
4	the writing hasbeen on the wall for a long time. this attitude is arrogant and entitled.
4	stop killing all our native species. look how many are already extinct
4	if we over fish any species well have none for future generations. a little bit is all you need to feed your whanau
4	the human race is becoming more greedy
4	i think they should have strict limits
4	###### ISTHE BEST  AND ##### IS AMAZING
4	if you were the fish how would you feel about you and your family being killed just for food.
4	most whitebait species are endangered. We need to protect them
4	because it not sustainabilty abd they oftendont pay tax when they sellit
4	no one should eat other living beings
4	whitebait are baby fish and should not have to die before they are parents to other baby fish.
4	people are so shortsighted and just want short term profits
4	its not a reasource to be profited of by companys itshould be managed accordingly so all nzers get an equal share ofthe qouta
4	whitebait are important and should be protectd
4	because any living creature should have the right to live
4	they are endangered native baby fish!!
4	no because they will become extinct
4	people are greedy taking more than thy need
4	how do you read a statistic saying 4 out of 6 species are in danger bc of humans and are like -lets not stop fishing them bc theyre yum-  huh??
4	why cant we be responsiblefor our land an species. we created it we need to fix it.
4	coz we rape an pillage our waters
4	i think  that in the year 2050 all of the ocean will be gone and destroyed thas why i dont eat fish or buy it
4	cause imupset asf!!!!!!!!! WOAH WOAH WOAHOMG OMG OMG
4	because they are on the vergeof extinctionand are really important toour waterways
4	ALL FISH JUST NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE. GO VEGAN
4	you dont deserve something more than itdeserves conservation
4	there should be a limit on how much to catch to ensure future generations
4	there should be strict limits on whitebait catches and sales and strictlimitson catches for ppersonaluse.
4	There is no point in eating the  Whitebait when you can just eat the plants. After all the fish have are living creatures just like us
4	Like any animal, if you keep catching and killing as many as you please, they'll eventually go extinct and that is very bad for the eco-system
4	if you take too many there wont be many left
4	people will only stop when there are none left
4	because people over fish and destroy wildlife populations
4	na te mea kua pau te inganga mo nga mokopuna
4	we need to look after the environment
4	becaues as humans we shouldhave enough self control to eat replenashible foodsources and not eat a species intoextinctionas we have in new zealand manytimesbefore
4	that you should have a certain amount that you can take per person
4	because there  wont be any left
4	the harvest and sale of the juveniles of endangered species mus stop
4	eating the fry of endangered fish species is just a bit stupid
4	we need to protect whitebait from over fishing.
4	because new zealands native fish will die of starvation
4	we needtoprotect our fauna and not be greedy
4	There should be sertan eareas where they can fish as catching to much could be bad and we might have no more
4	there should be a limit in order to preserve the species
4	they wont be able to reproduce and they will suffer
4	people shouldn't be able to catch as much whitebait  as they want because they are precious creatures that should be taken care of.
4	i feel angry because i like native animals. #### age #
4	its irresponsible and threatens the future of 6 species
4	Whitebait is going to go extibct because of humans!
4	because there shoukd be fre for al
4	the whitebait need to grow up otherwise there will be none left
4	to many endagered species get caught as whitebait.
4	many species of whitebait are endangered
4	they have tiny eyeballs and they are gross to look at
4	THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND
4	All people should at lest say a prayer before they take the fish because what  if you were a fish and fished you up. That is wht the fish  would feel like.
4	fair enough if ts to feed yourself. But not for profit
4	what if one day they go extinct
4	maybe dont drive a species to endangerment or extinction just to feed your greedy puku. idiot.
4	sthere needs to be limits on fishing numbers otherwise populations of whitebait wont be able to recover or sustained overtime. action on this needs to happen now to show our commitment to sustainable fishing and balance for the environment. fishing is a priveledge not a right.
4	we are over fishing all our natural resourses most of these species are already endangered we need to stop over fishing our toanga or they will become exstinct
4	whitebait are a taonga. we mustlook after them
4	not enough left for fishing now. they need time to recover.
4	i am angry because there should be a limit to the amount of white bait that is taken
4	because he didnt get off the plane and used racist slurs
4	because people are killing the whitebait
4	disappointed that we are even considering it
4	im angry people keep catching pink dolphins because they look cool
4	leave them alone if youwantfood grow it yourself leave wild things to themsleve
4	because they are living things andthey dobt do bad
4	we need controls so they continue to thrive for future generations
4	The waitbait must be protected or they will become extinct like some other fish that i dont know about.
4	people feel entitled and feel they should  have access to everything without thinking about the impact of their actionS.  Kuare
4	because im entitled to my opinion and am free to feel
4	morue extinction because of selfish people
4	we must protect our waters and the animals livin there
4	open your eyes read the stats
4	let fish be as they are
4	let them grow up and repopulate
