0	I agree with this idea but there also needs to be some system of dealing with bi-catch. I don't want fish caught to be wasted just because those fishing commercially have accidentally caught the wrong species while targeting the sustainable fish stocks.
1	It will make us more mindful of our consumption and lessen the burden we place on the sea
1	I would prefer to eat only sustainable food
0	It ecourages ethical choices. Provide sthe means to make that choice as or when you can afford it. One week you may only have money for cheap/unethical meat, next week you have the budget for making the choice to buy free range pork/chicken or sustainable fish.
1	The ocean is a precious ecosystem - we really can't keep fishing unsustainably.
0	We need to think more carefully about what we are eating and why, by only selling sustainably caught fish the demand for other fishing will reduce.
0	Yes! We have to set some regulations and guidelines. There'll be a flow-on effect to fishing methods, and hopefully prices will come down in the longer term.
1	Good practice to have sustainable fishing methods
0	Encouraging sustainable farming practices is important, and forcing suppliers to meet that need by excluding them from the market otherwise would effect change.
1	I'm hopeful this idea will take hold, as it's in keeping with the move to know where your food comes from and how it gets to the store. We are really good at over-fishing and this could put pressure on the industry to do better.
1	It seems like something that could be implemented from a legislative level, but it could reduce access to fish for lower economic groups when we are also trying to reduce reliance on red meat in the national diet.
1	We can't overfish our oceans - simple. Great idea, although the cost of food is already very high so an increase in fish prices concerns me. Also, this should be a global effort, not just a NZ one, otherwise it is pointless.
0	Great. For me its also about non-slave trade fishing too
4	Supermarkets shouldn't be selling ANY fish. People are so worried about saving the oceans by not using straws and plastic but hey here's an idea - JUST STOP EATING FISH!
0	Overfishing is a huge problem worldwide, and consumers barely know how much it impacts our oceans. Millions of marine wildlife, including dolphins, turtles, and various endangered species, are caught in fishing nets and killed with no regard whatsoever. I have seen photos of boats that have gone out fishing for "squid" and what they have caught is anything but. So much of this problem is caused by the demand from supermarkets and commercial businesses. If supermarkets refused to sell anything but sustainably caught fish, this would help alleviate the issues of overfishing, and see the fishing industry implement sustainable practices.
1	Supermarkets should only sell sustainable products, period.
1	sustainably caught fish would be more expensive, and a likely impact is that fish could become a luxury good, out of reach of ordinary people. I would be interested in exploring ways of fish farming for human food consumption, and leaving large parts of the ocean fisher-free, to allow them to recover
0	We're successful predators with the ability to understand the idea of "the future". We can manage our resource use in such a way we're not making species extinct in order to feed ourselves.
3	We always need a variety of options in the supermarkets. Lower income families still need to eat fish and the government is working hard on obesity particularly in children. Could the cost be subsidised? I don't think you can put a blanket rule on things like this. Variety is the spice of life.
3	How can we trust that fish on sale really is sustainably caught?
1	This would be great, but I lack confidence in the ability of our fishing industry and government to sustainably manage and protect New Zealand fisheries.
0	This is the only way we can ensure that we have kaimoana for future generations.
It also helps keep balance for all ecosystems on the planet.
This should be a blanket rule for anyone or any business selling fish.
0	I think we should stop all commercial fishing - or at least make the price reflect true value
0	One of the biggest reasons I don't eat much meat is that I'm worried about how sustainable and environmentally friendly the source is. If I could trust supermarket sources I may actually eat more meat.
0	Fisheries are a fantastic resource, let's manage them better to keep them productive into the future.
1	Supermarkets definitely need to be promoting and selling sustainably caught fish however I wouldn't like to think that this made it cost prohibitive for those on a low income family to include fish in their diet
0	Our oceans around us are a vital resource for the planet and overfishing destroys the balance. We need to pay the full price, not steal off generations to come
1	(I'm vegetarian and don't eat fish.) I would appreciate businesses supporting consumers in making more ecologically friendly choices.
1	My father is a recreational fisher who has noticed and commented on the decline of species of fish due to commercial fishing during his lifetime. Many like him only catch what they can reasonably use and would like to pass on this activity to the next generation. If our commercial fisheries are also catching only sustainably caught fish there may be opportunity for some of those other fish stocks to recover
0	Great, but some say there is no such thing as sustainably caught fish (outside of farmed ones).
0	na te mea kei konei te wheke
3	that isbad coz we love our fissh!!!
1	all blacks to win the world cup
1	We  should all try as hard as we can to rescue our environment. Even if it costs us more. Our planet is priceless.

1	its a good idea to look after our oceans and the creaturesin them.
4	Nobody should be catching or eating fish

0	many of the fish which are bein caugh and sold are becoming endangered.... the idea of having a sustainble source of fish isidea however the concern is policing it
1	i dont think it will happen but id  like it to. we need to stop net trawlling  because of the bycatch.
3	because our plant is already getting destrod and hurt
0	Because if supermakets are only selling fish that are caught a sustainable way. Less fish will be killed.
3	How can we trust all supermarkets?

1	Fish is an important part of diet.
3	They shouldn't sell fish at all. Over fishing has destroyed our ocean environments nearly beyond repair.
1	otherwise we will have no fish at all

0	over fishing is a huge biodiversity issue
1	bring bck the balance of the eco system
1	if we do not do this. no more fish we can consume and it will break the eco system in the ocean
4	fish should live and not be eaten grrrr
1	hope make us live and thrive bt realityis alays here to catch up on s andthe human needs....
0	excited because this would sustaine fish and over all our ocean.
4	for the future of our kaimoana
0	its  always going to be alright
1	we need fish for future generations....unless they become vegans...?
1	too many people care only about the price
1	whytf would u not do it if u could afford t do so?
1	we need to look after what wehave now for the future
0	what is best for the ocean and its critters is best for us all
0	fish do live and are important we cant just be angry if we pay for lifes
0	it will save our oceans. we will be able to have fish forfuturegenerations
0	because we need to be more catious and sustainable
0	bcaus fish ar fiebds nt food
0	or there will be no fish left
0	there will be fish in the future
1	its a great and hopeful idea. ialso think more percentage of the ndustry just care about making money unfortunately.
0	we should protect all ecoystems no matter the costs
0	no need for the excess waste that is produced from over fishing and trawling
1	....  because there are options that are better than the status quo
0	I think if retailers set the example then customers will follow.
0	its within our capabiityto do so
0	fsh farming is extremely resurce intensiveand pollutes waterways.
0	sustainability is way more important than cost
0	we need more fish from the sea for you and me
1	we should fish only whast we aer sure that wwe caan restock
0	because i want to go fishing when im an old man and actually catch something
0	sustainable fush help suport the environment  and therefore will be better
0	cause i wanna live long enough to find love
1	it can help us stop more extinction
0	we only buy msc certfied fish at the moment and the only options are tuna and salmon. this would mean that we would have other options of sustainable fish for when we eat fish
0	beacause we want fish to be in our seas forever! if they were to be extinct it would be worldwide regret not implimenting action sooner.
1	sustainability is paramount we shouldoff set it with fish farming to take pressure off the worlds fish supplys also stringent controls in place to monitor asian influence
0	i beieve it's the right decision
1	they need to just stopselling any other kind.
0	i think its important for us to rethink our food !  For the health and wellbeing of ourselves and our planet xx
0	save more fish create more jobs
1	fish farms have their associated risks for the environment too.
0	we need to think of theearth forour future generations
1	if we catch all of the fish then none will be left
0	good for large companies to encourage and provide sustainable options
1	comanes should be held accountable. money  wnt save the world
1	Itd be nice to have a sustainable ecosystem and not worry about possible extinction
2	hi my names ##### # and i like ###
0	so that we have biodiversity and fish for future generations
0	we should only harvest anything if it is sustanable
1	consumers will choose cheap if giventhechoice. dont give us the choice
0	its just something thatn eeds to happen
1	because the oceans and planet are dying
0	so we can keep a balance ocean
0	i think that eco-friendly is best.
1	it might help New Zealand have more than a chance in getting it's birds and trees back
1	i think that eco-friendly is best but you don'thave to raise the price the fish
0	because all birds are awesome period
2	Absolutely no idea so i dont care
1	they should leave all the fish in the sea
1	it will help the fish breed
0	i think we should bdecreasng our consumption all together. But this is a good start
1	no fish would mean worse then just none to eat
0	We  need to actively protect the land we live in
0	why dont we go vegan problem solved tehe
0	global fish stocks are at critical levels and locally caught fish are more sustainable
1	we cannot deplete our natural resources and decrease our biodiversity for the selfishness of humanknd.
1	I think that it matters because we need to bring back the fisph population that has been lost over the years due to overfishing. Not only for us but for native species that don't have enough food because of our ations.
1	we need to take action on preserving our planet
1	we have to preserve the natural resources and treasure the environment while we can.
1	its a start. but we need more and frombigger countries like USA China.
0	deep sea fishing has proven to be destructive to coral habitats and othe marine life
1	nota big fan of eating fish but i hope this can be achieved
1	we already have lots of extinct animals dont need more
0	because overfishing is destroying our oceans
0	there arent many more fish at all. and thatsrather sad. fish should be friends not food. we also need to be seeing more ish in the workplace
0	we need to think about sustainability and the legacy we leave our children granchildren and those to come
0	i really care of annimals so i am super excited about no petrol cars in the future
0	i think it is a really good idea
1	i hope this is the direction that the world is going towards- otherwise we will destroy future resources for the next generation.j
0	we hav to look after Tangaroa for our Mokopuna
0	all the good stuff supermarkets sell
0	I think its a brilliant idea.
0	i want to save the environment
3	means people with a lwer incme will be unabe to afford them

2	feed more fish.  fish are yum. feed nz with fish i say
2	ilike fish fd nz with fish
0	i care a lot for annimals so i think that is a good idea
4	that we should ban all commercial fishing and let recreational fishers  catch all they need abd give to or neighbours.
0	its nice  to have them doing it because they are saving thier lives
0	if we dont work to mak our environment sustainable then we are destroying our future.
0	consumers shouldnt have to make the choice it should be regulated
1	people are still to concerned about their own back pockets and not the world we live in
0	good time to start thinking about sustainable fishing
1	i think it could be a good idea  but it would take avery long time to put it in place .  And how would you control it ?
3	you do not know what is in it
0	there will be fish for my next seven generations

0	theocean isone of ourumost valuable resources lets keep it that way
0	so we can keep it for future generations
1	it is a good start... and starting is not easy!
0	the oceans will be fishless by 2050 if w contnue to use unsustainable fishig methods
0	its important to look after our seas
1	maybe good sense will overcome capitalism
0	overfishing affects not ony the fish stocks but the wider ecosystem as well. sustainable fishing or not fishing at all is better for biodiversity and the climate and us! need to be looking to the future
1	i wonder do we trust the supermarkets to provide sustainably caught fish?
0	consmers need to make more sustainable choices with food and enironment
0	i think that we need to look after our ocean and sustainably fishing is the only way forward.
4	they shouldn't sell fish at all
1	We definately do need higher taxes on non sustianable food but in conclusion thefree marketneeds to decide whats on themarketand whats not
0	We want there to be fish in the future.
0	because it would be more enviromently stable.
1	because we should be mimicking natural cycles and rhythms. because we should working in hamony with the naturalworld to ensurewe are leaving behind aworld fitforthe generations who are yet to come.
1	we need fish for the future
1	its the onky way to preserve the food sourse for the future
0	i want mygrandchildren toenjoy fishand chips
0	or not eat them at all
0	Ko tenei aorangi no matou e tiaki ana moake tonu
1	think it is important to deal ith our resources in a meaningful way to make sure that biodiversity and climate wount get worse
0	if we are idiots and over fish then there will be nothig let and another creature humans have hunted to extinction
1	how do supermarkets knw that it is sustainay caught. fishneeds to be a reaonable price not a silly expensive price it is today.
3	for a country of onnly 4.5million people we seem to polute the environment more than larger countries. we focus on art and notenvironmenta clenup.
1	its worthsaving the environment rather than killing it and not even being able to live comfortably
0	because it's the right thing to do.
1	i think its a great idea tatweshouldbutitmigh take some convincibg togetpopleto comly
1	I hate the wastefulness of the bycatch.
1	new zealand is a very advanced country. it should keep on advancing
0	it means a more sustainable future.
1	its important not to over fish and only catch whats required t eat
1	we need to make changes to protect the earth before thes impacts are irreversible
1	because then fish can be more free and breed more
3	how much species will not make 2021
1	as long as the fish taste good and there are more fish to eat. i agree
1	i people know  enough they might  care
0	animal in our plates should rare.
0	because its the ethical thing to do
1	that its important to maintain fishpoulations
1	If we over fish almost all types of fish will become extinct and we won't be able to eat fish.
0	Because it means we are thinking about the future.
0	this will make the fish more fresh but also will hekp some fish become more free and more species will become less endangered
0	trawling and dredging andset nets are destroying our oceans and the qms has made it worse if stopped our oceanswill flourish
0	i don't want the people to kill the fish they are not allowed to catch
1	I think the fish all cool and nice but l think can te papa do something for fish likes NZ's fish or fish live 's water
4	i think suoermrkets are creating a supply and denand. we dont need o have ish in mrkets every day

0	yes because it is better for the enviroment and there would be a less chance that they could get exstinked.
2	because i dont know the difference
2	otherwise we will run outof fish
1	We need to share the seas with all creatures.
1	i think that we should only sell sustanibly caught fish because otherwise we wont have have enough fish in the ocean.
1	It would be amazing for our enviroment
1	so people are aware of wher everything is coming from awareness instigaes action
0	we should respect the resources we have and live harmoniously with nature
0	because its 2019 and we out here being sustainable
0	we only have one planet. if we care more about money than protecting the lives of everything on it the world willbe destroyed
1	We wont notice the short term added cost. people still buy petrol despite the gradual price increase. but it will save the long term cost
2	i dont know so i dontreallycare

2	you knw when i was youbger i used to be reallyscared of thermoniters
1	peoples atttude has to change . we have to stop prioritising price over environmental issues
1	we might manage to save our food sources and live more harmoniously
0	because it could be something new
0	fisheries will be forced to fish sustainably and protect our fish species
1	it will take time before everyoe is onboard
0	kia noho ora ai te taiao

4	why hasnt this been the norm from the beginning
2	i juzt dont gve a ####
1	if we dont make some changes we will loose our sea life
0	Im excited because  it will improve the long term fish supply and quality of our oceans.
0	because it will b bette or the animals
0	because new zealand fish is sustainable and could be world leading
0	I think that super markets should only sell sustainably caught fish because what people do now is not ood enough. Try harder people!
0	fish are a thig too so how wuld youblike it lk
0	we have lots of food choices and it would helpif supermarkets eliminated unsustainablechoces
3	me not trust sources lke they sops and fisheries
0	food should come from sustainable sources
0	so we have more fish to explore
0	because unsustainably caught seafod shouldnt be sold
1	start small and biggerhings willcomeif we all take responsibility
0	because if we kill all the fish they will be extinct
0	our earth is the most important thing we have
0	because we need to make sarter more sustainable choices in our everyday lives and this is a good start
2	i dont understand ths questin but the form looked cools yeah..
1	kaimoana is a precious resource that we should appreciate.
2	i don't really care cause i don't like fish

0	that u wellgive me a potato.
3	my dad is not goin off this thing
1	my ####### get off this thing
1	Once we make this the norm prices will go down as fishing abides to new regulation.
1	i think we should completely ban fishing due to its negative effect on the oceanic ecosystem.Thus decreasing the population of aquatic organisms. However making fishing sustainable is a positive step in the right direction
4	cheap fish is a relible source if protein for thepoorestamongst us. such a move with hurt thm
1	By overfishing we damage whole eco systems. hence is why i don't eat fish at all
1	beyonce is a beauty and one of the best singer and erformers ever to exist
1	we need to  ensure survival of the species so thatfuture generation get to eat fish too
0	better for the environment        save iur iceans
1	because if we dont do that there wont be any fish for our own children...
3	we will run out before putting it into practice
1	I think sustainbility is extremely important and disregarding it will bring on huge consequences
1	if big companies take more resonsibility there is more chance of good changes
0	our ecosystem is far more important than money.
0	we need to protect our marine life
1	i think it will be better because it sholud get the popularation up with our fish in nz and people should also try to use less plastic in nz for all our sea animals
0	I think it is important to sustain all food sources water and habitatas
3	this idea could go out of hand yet its still could agood idea
4	no one should eat fish at all
0	fish stocks are deminishing due to human consuption
1	cause we  cant ruout of fish or well be hungry
4	because people willbecome broke cha ching
2	i think thatlucia doescare but also doesnt
0	that it's really important and not  only some shops  should sell them
0	we need to protect the fishfrfuture generations
1	that they need to hurry up
1	its better than being unsustainable however no fish should be consumed
1	Ideally the amount of fish we should be eating is none. But if people decide to do it; It should be done in a sustainable way. We should reduce the overall amount of fish we are catching and consuming.
1	we need to look after nz
1	marine organisms are important for carbon cycling
1	In order to becoe more sustainable and caring about our natural world we have to make sacrifices
0	sustainable fishingis the only way to save our ocean diversity
0	fish in the  water fishin the sea we all jump up with a one two three
4	because. my girlfriend july said so
1	without enough fish in the ecosystemwe will have a less diverse ocean resulting in no fish in future generations

0	that the sea is important and fish should be available for generations t come
0	better for the envioment as well as healthier for both the fish population and our health
1	it's never too late to think about the future
0	it would give fishstocks time to recover
0	we need to realise that we must foot the bill if we are to save the oceans
0	Sustainable fishing will allow ocean populations to recover from overfishing. Sustainable fishing  not only helps the target species but reduces bycatch of other species as well.

0	we need to save are oceans
0	the more we pretect our ocean happer we will be. the more we take the less we leave
0	Its the only way togther on the blue planet
3	to much is thrown away by supermarkets
1	i think that its reasonable because they should care enough about the moana to care for it as well as profit and sustain themselves from it
0	it will be good for nature and for the world
0	it willmake the world a better place and fish for the future
3	thats something but we all need to do much more. less consumption in general. stop making and using plastic or we'll never get it out of the bio system.
0	i am too bord to do something for this
0	it will be good to respectour ocean creatures even if it means spending a bit more money
0	i m to bord to do anyfwing faw tis
0	because it allows for the continuation of ocean life and for ecosystems to carry on thriving while humans are able to purchase and benefit from the nutrients provided by fish

1	we should be more concious about te impact of our consuer choices
0	to save other species for future generation to come so that our children can also see what we have seen
0	i think that they should go through with it because it will save a lot of animals in the sea
0	because if they take fish from the sea there will hardly be anymore fish in our waters
1	because i want my grandchildren to be able to live in a world where their are different species in the sea not just in captivity.
0	we need to fish sustainably or our fish will go extinct.
0	my name #### save the turtles
1	heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy im not hopeful but wotever
1	becuase maybe  it will lead to better stuff
1	hopeful by being nice to ppl and dont b
0	i want to know my food is sustainable
0	itsmore sustainable for nature and guilt free for people
1	Cheap on one side more expensive on the other. Why we cant pay fare price for a good quality products and labor.
1	i think it is important to save biodiversity and give a chance for  reproduction amongs the  sea  creatures.so we definitely must to reduce our consumarism.
1	it would be great but realistically would people be able to afford it?
1	its about profit and consumer cost
0	nothing is more important than protectig our environment and unique ecosystem. if you disagree youre a capitalist pig
0	we just dont need that much
3	mconcerned that fish will  become expensive.....and wewill import from cuntries that do not manage their fisheries
1	we should eat sustainably caught fish but i am lucky enough to be able to afford to pay more.
1	selling sustainably caught fish is a great idea but putting that idea into action is anothermatter all together. actually putting the plan into action would take a lot of work and effort. it would be fantastic if it worked. its one thing to talk about it and another to DO it...
0	sustainability is important. more exensive fish now or no fish in the future. hmmmmmmmmmm
3	will affec poor peoples ability to eat healthiy
1	Over-fishing is a serious environmental issue which has greater effects on the ecsystem than most people realise. Therefore by being able to confirm to the public that fish can be caught and sold in a sustainable manner is very important for the future.
1	I am hopeful that New Zealand can work together toward a sustainable future.
0	because fish are dying . there are not enough fish n the sea
0	IT IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
0	otherwise there wobt be any left
1	we shouldnt have to sacrifice treating our environment right for affordable food
0	THIS IS THE ONLY PATH FORWARD
1	we need to have alot of fish
1	w e need tosave our planet

2	cause i dont give a fsh
4	cause my mum took my vape
0	im just a poor boy nobodyloves me hes just a poorboyfrom a poor family
3	cause it might be a terrible idea
0	because fish are vital to the marine ecosystem so there would be many consequences if fish arent sustainably caught
1	It seems like a good idea but unless more can be done to stop illgal fishing it will not make much difference
4	fish is good and im poor
1	because having a sustainable population is better than not having it at all
0	that we need to look after our fragile coastal environments
1	humans have a responsbiity to be kaitiaki and protect our native toanga. we cant do that by ating them
3	i don't  like things being killed.

0	sustainability is a more progressive mean of tackling climate change and ecological breakdown in a more progressive and better way
0	BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR OCEANS AND SEALIFE
0	cause it's an important step in the right direction to stop extreme climate change
0	i think this reflects the true cost of consuming fish
0	It would be best for the enviroment if we think more about the long term effects
1	hopefully theyll do it honestly but ....
1	Future generations e.g my children will have fish to eat
0	i like fish but not the smell did u knw im vegan
3	supermarkets if they are sell the fish cost more in future and people cant afford it. Y® n?v?r knw hpp?n?d
3	we need to respect the nature if we want to eat fish in the future
1	we should make more sustainable food choices including diversifying thetypes of fish we eat.
0	Because the inmoral care of our sources of water and the animals within then ultimately serve as a means to destroy the ecosystems and our very own livelyhood
1	we need to preserve out natural food sources for our future generations and eco system
1	theres alwas going to be the small group of peopletat want cheaper fish whom supermarkets have to cater to but hopefully more people will buy sustainably from now on
3	it is difficult to ensure that all thefish is sustainably caught
1	it is a step in the right direction
0	needs to happen for our future
0	fish should be caught by longline to stop bycatch

0	it will make a huge differnce to thevway we shop and consume.Also having huge positive impactson tte ecosytem and help preserrve marine life
1	because fish species are in serious decline. if we only support sustainable fishing then we can helprecover these populationsand keep the stability of the food chain
0	helps ensure fish for future generations
0	its a great idea in theory but we are a long way off
0	to be more focussed on sustaining the environment locally and globally
1	hard to be hopeful  but do anyway
0	Sometimes we need legislation to help push our everyday actions in a better direction in consideration of future generations
3	Telling people that the fish comes from sustainable source may lead to exploitation of this resource by consumers
3	i think the food in the super market are dirty
3	i think this is a bad idea because what if the fish is yuck and will make you sick
1	I believe that the environment is what we need to take action on.
1	I would feel hopeful because it would ensure that the magority of fish will have better and safer lifes.
0	umm i dont know what sustainable fish isbt whatever you think is best most of the others will too.
3	im worried that others will not like it
0	visiting in new zealand makes me excited
0	all products consumed should benfit nz

0	Everyone should being trying to achieve a happier and healthier NZ.
0	Better chance for sustainable fisheries in the long run
0	that it will be good for the fish
1	I would feel hopeful because I am awesome!
1	fish r just tryna blopblop yknow?
1	it's important to look after our oceans and fish
1	"sustainably" caught is not always as  reliable or helpful to the environment as it sounds. As long as fish are being caught and or raised in ways that are renewable as well as heathy for us the marine environment and waterways and not  just something for companies to slap on products as a label for appeal im all for it
0	fishing nets make up 50 per cent of ocean pollution
1	the ocean and its resources need to be protected. hopefully this would help
0	It is so important that corporations take responsibility and make sustainable actions. we can't rely on the public making good choices  it has to be large scale
0	We should respect the land and seas and the animals that were here before us. It is not our place or right to change it.
1	I HOPE THAT HUMANS CAN CARE MOREFOR NON HUMANS
0	This is the only way given our planet and the amount of people on it.
0	sustainabilityis key to an ongoing good civiisation in ahealthy earth
0	Fish and sea food should on be sold if caught sustainibly. Otherwise we risk losing more species to extinction and further damaging marine ecosystems.
1	I hope a balance can be struck so that this can be achieved without turning lower earning households away from fish
1	becuase it wouldmean that good sence triumphs over greed
0	it would enable a sustaibaable catch into the future a sustaibable fishibg economy for future generations
0	If we do not start helping the earth now it might be  too late soon. The problem is we need everyone to help but not everyone cares. But everyone should because we are destroying our own home. Doing that wil not give people an option and sometimes that is the best thing to do because people can be very stupid and they often just think of themselves and not of the consequences
0	this means its better for the envorinment
0	it would show that we had begun to take action and care for our future
1	impotant to sustain the future and all animal wellbeing
0	We need to be kaitiaki of our future.
1	we are aready moving towards it
0	willmake a difference over time giving populations a chanceto recove
2	beacause  i do notknow what that maens
0	it is imperative we manage our fish sustainably
1	it is very good so we will never run out of fish to eat sowe can end world hunger
0	the best way to save the fishes would be to stop eating them but this is the next best thing
0	i think its a good idea
0	i think thatit will make the earth bette
0	I think that it would be good for the enviroment
1	WE COULD START FARMING MORE SPECIES OF FISH
0	superarkets are the primary food supply  of many urban citizens so their supply impacts what peple buy
4	Thats a stupid idea because there will be mre fishes in the sea so more to eat for sharks.Then the sharks population will soar and will start to attack more and more babies on the beaches. soon humanity extinction will be real
1	fish should be cauht at a certain time of the year.
3	we need to keep them alive
1	because our fish r becoming endangered and we need to save some for the birds
1	sustainable fisheries are possible but there need to be incentives and rewards
1	because the earth is dying quickly and we need to save as many things as we can
1	i think this is good because less diseases will be caried
1	because you shouldnt kill innocent animals.
0	Sustainable fish supplies are a logical way of everyone being able to eat fish in the future.
1	supermarkets and other large companies have the responsibility to start creating and utilising sustainable practices. Im hopeful they wil take the seriousness of that on board
0	there is no suxh thing as a sustainable commerica fishing operation
2	##### ###### smells like ### . more like ##### ########
0	it is vital cos we gone be dead
0	its the right thing to do
0	The current fishing methods are not sustainable
0	very goodidea . shoukd definatly action it
1	because its really important to treat animals good
1	it sounds like a good idea i  am hopeful that it will work
2	i dont really think about fish and supermarkets im  a kid
1	that it is a good  idea
0	because over 25 PERCENT of the oceans population are overfished
0	Because over 25 percent of the oceans population are overfished
1	its important to start making change even if we have to make sacrifices
0	ko te toit®  o ng tamariki o Tangaroa te tino kaupapa
1	this is a great idea to support good fishing practices ad our marine industryand also maintain our marine reserves
1	great idea. i hope it happens :)
0	because  i feel so close to  those  aniamals
0	wipe then out  all of them.
0	there is a ### in the ####
0	i will lower consumption by killing #####
0	let us jump off of a mountain together!
4	Becsuse I am A N G E R Y
4	###### ###### eyes oh ####### why did you say that
0	the ocean is one of mankinds best source of food water and rereaction ad we should respect it

4	dolphins and nontarget organisms are caught in the process of non sustainable fishing
1	fishers kill endangered mamals  and tuna tht takes hundreds of yeras to grow. ban this for the lucrative but shanmeful pet food market. some pets eat better than some humans. our sea  is being plundered and  these limited resources  are precious
0	anything to help preserve our planet for future generations to enjoy
0	honestly i think its a positive step towards not sellib animal products at all!!!!!!!
1	not sure consumers would pay more on a regular basis
1	I feel this is a good idea because if all the fish die; our ocean would not be the same.
0	i want my children and theirs toenjoy fish so i think  we should pay what it is worth. eating kaimoana should be a treat and we should treasure every bite.
0	because its good for the enviroment
1	otherwise there will be nothing left in the future
0	that should the least they can. if its unsusrainable then dont sell it
1	only way to ensure fish are around for the future
1	If legitimate; short term cost leads to long term gain
1	i think its rally importabt to preserve our sea life for future generations. we shouldnt be the disruptors of natural food chains
1	i think that we should look after the other species that share our planet. just because we are more advanced in our skills does not mean that we can kill other species to the point where they are exstict!
0	WE are killing and polluting our oceans we need to respect it and take what we need
0	we shouldnt eat fish at all anymre. at least not until the amounthas recovered.
1	this requires everyone to care and priorities it especially coporations would will loseprofit.
0	so there are plenty of fish for future generations xx
0	we will run out of species to eat if we are not more sustainable. by that point cost wont matter
0	first of all they shouldnt even be selling fish:)
0	yes supermarkets need to hep the enviroment by getting others to help
0	a great step towards a brighter cleaner future for our tamariki
1	we need to start making the right positive steps to save our planet and the resourceswithin.  how can we do that if our main focus is money and not the resources that provide us with life
1	because i want a brighter future and enough for for all
1	i think i will be good.
0	Because sustainability is reeeeeally important and it would be great if supermarkets buy fish from sustainable sorce even if it is reeeeeally expensive.
1	more balanced and long term approach. can use canned and frozen options to lower cost
1	If supermarkets don't do this fish will come extinct and thatwill not be good.
1	i think if its the norm it will become afforedable over time but a massive move like a change in law would force that sooner
1	it seems logical to create a sustainbal eco systim lest food sorces
0	if youwant fish go catch it
1	i think it would be very good and can help fish stay on earth for a very long time. if we keep going theway we are we will have almost no fish left and that could be crucial to our survival.
0	Because its about time they thought of the future rather than profit. Its not the 1950s anymore. Evrything is connected
0	because fish are cooland godand if theydied thewhole entireecosystem cool ilikephish pis ihsi phish
1	we have tobe careful with what is left in the world. ration what is caught. it is not about saving industry but about saving the world.
3	the fisheries and most consumers are driven by greed
0	if we moderate our diets there is every chance we can grow backthe diversity that we are losing for posterity
1	its  small step in the right direction
0	i am excited because there will be more fish in the sea
0	so wehave fish in the future
0	Its a good idea because peoplewont get food posioning from the processed fish.
1	it makes sense for everything we do in life to be sustainable.
0	because it will ensure that fish will keep producing
0	I think that we need to remember we are lucky to have such vast amounts of delicious seafood here in NZ. We need to make sure that this resource can be enjoyed for generations to come
0	THE THE SEAS ARE FULL OF DIVERSE MARINE ANIMALS AND PLANTS. THE FIHES SWIM AROUND SHARKS LOOK FOR THEIR PREDATORS AND THE ANEMONES GENTLY SWAY TO THE FLOW OF THE WATERS UNDERNEATH. IF WE CHOOSE TO CATCH FISH SUSTAINABLY WHICH WILL SUFFICE TH NEW ZEALAND COMMUNITY AND THE MARINE COMMUNITYAS WELL BOTH ILL BENEFIT FROM THIS SOLUTION REGARDLESS OF PRICE
3	we overexploit natural resources too much and upset ecosystems.
1	because i think theres hope in the world
1	i got beaten up by my bestfrien
1	b?c®s? ® wnt f®sh t nt d®? ®t
1	i think that everything should be sustainable.
2	i think we should pick up rubbish
0	fish is cheaper than some meat now so itwould b okif it was more expensive
0	i think that the fish population wont die if we do it sustainably
1	because the number of fish in our oceans is declining at an incredibily rapid rate and is not sustainable. if we catch all of the breedingfish therewillbe none left
0	as I think businesses should be supportingthis idea not just individualsand the public
0	consuner demandwill force change in fishing practices simlar to free range eggs
1	becaus then spcies will go extinct
0	we shouldnt eatfood thats unsustainable or well destroy the marine ecosystems
0	because we need to save our oceans and sealife which is currently in crises. zero bycatch
0	if we want fish for our children abd mokos then we need to make better choices now... and anyway animals have rights too.
1	i think that would be fantabulous.
1	we need to let our oceans and kaimoana recover and prevent bycatch of seabirds and marine mammals
0	then we can be happy eating them!
0	we dont just need our fisheries to be sustainaby caught that isnt enough because a fisherycan be sustained at very low levels of abundance. we mustmanage our fisheries for high abundance. we need thriving oceans not seas where the marine life is sustained at 80 percent empty.
0	it is essential for the survival of marine mammals and seabirds and the whole marine ecosystem
1	its a good idea thanks hop youliked it
0	because i like fish and dont want to hurt them.
4	i think they should stop killing harmless fish because its not nice and you might kill other things beside fish.
4	Fish should not be killed because you are killing harmless animals.
1	i am hopeful to find a place where I can sleep because yesteday Isleep late so...
4	I am really piss off of this opinion
1	we need to stop over fishing by countries outside our region exploiting our resource
1	It will help mantainbd restore marie species populatins
1	pay more now and actually still have an ocean.
0	Consumer attitudes are half the battle.
1	we need to sustain our resources for furure generations
1	bcause i belive that breedig fish is okay as long as the fish are relved to wild life oceans as soon as they have grown.
0	keep our native wild life alive
2	cause its fish  and it tastes  nice
0	we should offer good choices at ok price. make it easier for more
1	future needs to be bright and this is foward thinking
0	BECAUSE FISH ARE CRUCIAL TO THE BALANCE OF THE SEA BEING RIGHT
0	I think its a exciting idea as there is so much bycatch and extinction going on lately it will be good to have a good fish market
0	ww need to ensure that theere are fish for their own future and for biodiversity.  what will other species eat if we keep taking and taking.
1	it would mean we wouldn't run out of the fish wwe eat
0	we should not overfish as we could run the risk off some species being extict or at risk
0	without sustainable fishing soon wewill have no fish species to  fishfor
1	without sustainabke fishing we will run out of this natural resource and no one will get the benefit.  long term committment. long term gain
0	when all the fish have beencaught only then will we realize  that we can not eat a dollar note
1	Money cant buy us our animals back
0	So that the fish won't go extinct
3	we dont have as muchfish in the sea
1	as long as its not over that amount our taongawill be able to replenish.
0	This is the change needed for a sustainble future
1	i think we should protect our oceans and sea life  and people should only take what they need
1	it's good because we get to eat nice fish.
3	money wil cause people to make poor decisions
3	Because I think that they will never do it
1	We are moving toward more sustainable practices. With more public pressure the supermarkets will react. Just like with plastic bags.
1	i think it might help the environment
1	we need to save the oceans
1	fresh fish is healther and tastes much better
1	everything should be sustainable and clean
1	sustainable fishing practices help preserve our planet for future generations while the present populous gets to enjoy it  now.
1	cause the baby fish get sad when papa fish doesnt come home
1	because it is important for the sustainability of the planet. however less fish should be sold too not simply only sustainable ones
1	we need to start pulling our head out of our ####
0	More important to have collective wellbeing
1	it is a first step in the right direction - but it would be even better if they only sold sustainable food
2	becuse i don't careny if i get candy
1	because the fish will be more fresh
3	i think  that you a ### and i dontcare
2	life is life too much imagrants here
4	this is a topic that doesnt need to be discused right now
1	Set a dream. Make  a  goal. choose the  right path & you will have a successful life. Full of happiness & gratitude.
0	because then  the fishers wouldn't over fishthe oceans
0	saving our environment is so important
0	i think it will be great to save and the fish
1	I think it would be A good idea
1	Great idea but only if its enforced
0	fresher thenthe fish they have forsale
1	we need take better care of our oceans and those who call it a home.
4	to much fishing when you could be having fun with your great grandchildren
1	they shouldnt only sell them. there should be other fish on sale butjust less.
0	everything should be sustainable evenif its nore expensive
0	I think that this would help the earth in the  long run even if its a bit harder for the people at first
1	we need to sustain for our children
4	fish are creaturesso we leave them alone
1	this would be great.we need to think about how to make it affordable
1	our fish resources are on the verge of extinction so we should now look at sustainable alternatives.
1	this is a sustanable way t control fish stock
3	there willbe no fish and thats not good!!
2	it does not make a difference
0	i have experinced first hand the attrocties of commercial fishing i.e bycatch and dumping
1	im not super excited because it costs more but it should happen
0	everything the supermarkets sell should be sustainable!
1	we should help the environment howeverwe can
1	i think its a great idea
1	If onlu sustainbl options are provided people will become acustomed to them and it will be the norm so every willbe acting more sustainable
3	because there want be any fish left.
1	cause it means we wll live longer as a human rac?- ######
1	i tink it would be better because it i more sustinable forte world.
0	if not then ther wont be any fish left
1	it will take time and resilienc buteventuallythepublic will demand a sustainable food chain.
0	because i am here at te papa
2	that it does matter if the fish re more expensive
4	that it should only stay the same
0	Because then we will have more fish to enjoy in the future even if itdes cost mre we needto look afterour sea creatures
1	better for fish popullation and ocean health
0	Fish should always be cought sustainable because of the ocean
1	i think in time the process will become more efficient and less costly than the more traditional unsustainable methods.
1	People need to be more aware of where their food is coming from.
1	This shouldve been a move a long time ago. We come from the land and we cant let our greed makeus forget
1	it could be dificult to make this possible.but it is a goog idea
1	it is the right way to go. but it is easy said than done
0	we cannot keep fishing unsustainably or fish stocks will run out.
0	becaue we have a duty to protect our waterways
1	we often only give focusand management to whatwecan see. our marine areas are at crisis point. we need responsible fisheries as well as influence fron a consumer level. we dont even know or measure what is sustainable so how do supermarkets implement this
0	should have happened a long time ago!!!
1	Really Id prefer a vegan green lifestyle and for supermarkts not to sell fish or meat.
1	People arealways more awarewhen it directly hurts their pocket. There should be a substancial tax or fine applied to fish that is known to be unsustainable.
1	struggle to understand how humans will change as we are so driven by money
0	Sustainable fishing is extremely importantfor the maintenance of fish populations and we should be putting our stomachs where our mouths are!!
1	we need to beome better and be more respectful.
1	so they do not become extinct. save the planet. save everyone and everything.
0	We need to look after our planet.
0	Having sustainable fishing means that our marine lifecan begin to flourish again and this will have a positive impact on our eco system. We are kaitiaki of our moana and whenua...
1	It is important to make sure that we are only getting fish that are reasonably old so we preserve fish and keep the population thriving.
4	people culd die because of that
1	we might be able to stop from overfishing and polluting th ocean. Might help reduce the damaging effects of commercial fishing
0	our ocean life needs to be ooked after and sustainable fishing is one way  of helping our ocean whist also looking after ourselves
1	need to stopwastibg food. this incudes animals such as cows etc. too much is going to waste and it is destroying the earth. there are countries overseas that are starving and we are here throwing too much into the waste. this is promoting pests to multiply.
0	so fish in the wild would be ableto breed
1	it  would be so great to see mor things happening
1	could be very good if everyone is ensred access so that it is not a privilege of a few
0	we need to shift away from unsustainable agricultural products and practices.
0	then i would be able to start eating fish again
0	someone has to start doing something
0	any step towards keeping or fish around is a good step. its not like kiwis cant afford it.
1	Hopefully fish won't keep dying so we can have a fancy lunch. Fish re a symbol of the ocean so don't kill all of dem
0	Meat is now replaceable but the oceans are not.
0	becausei we need to be thinking grester tha our own pleasure and hatis best for theerth
0	this isimportant for the ocean and limiting pollution. the fish will be better for our health and will be happier
0	Fishing is extremely unsustainable and needs to be controlled
0	I think we should be looking after our oceansand waterways by fishings ustainably especially with our changing environment
3	policy follows the money not the science
0	more healthy and free from chemicals
0	cause t is better for the enviroment and keeps nz green and bluesafe
1	i think we need more fish fsrms
0	everythingneeds to be done sustainbly in order for our future to be positiveand ongoing
1	Fish is expensive anyway so an increase in price doesnt make too much of a difference
1	i want to  go   home fromm fairlane
1	hopefull that they do but i dont eat fis
1	we can save the planet itsnot too late!!
0	It will help to reduce our pressure on the natrual environment
2	reallly no onewill care what fishthey eat and wheretheir from...
0	i think its important to look at the long term. not the now
0	we need a  change our planet is dying
0	i dont think were meant to eat proteins in the quantity we do. would prefer sustainability and smaller portions
0	coud reinforce fishing practices and better understanding of seasonal foods.
3	Fish is already damn expensive. Raising prices is a terrible idea.
0	it ws very nice to see allf a nature in this place it was amazing
0	BECAUSE IT WAS VERY NICE TO SEE ALL OF TANE MAHUTAS TAMARIKI
1	Because we do not want people eating fish that could possibly kill them
0	it will help  natural fish populations recuprate back to their healthy numbers.    We could also consider consuming less animal products including fish
0	i think that it would be good to addmre maori stuff?
1	because the ocean produces 50-80 precent of the world oxygen so over fishing will cause the food web to mess up which may mess up our xyen supply
1	because our wild life is important
2	i dont eat fish. fish are friends not food
0	because i am at te papa
1	i want  to catch fish and have fish at te shops
0	because it is important to consume food/animals that have been  involved inan ethical process. it is also important for us to not consume more animals than we should :)
0	enviroment is more important than money
0	it protects our population of fish to our area.
0	because itwill lower the amount of endagred fish
0	##### will be a great president
2	I Like my cheap fish and expensive sashimi alike. say no to fish discrimination
1	nz should be more aware of thesustainable practise for fishing our extensive fishing grounds and be better guardians
1	change needs to happen if we want to call earth home for future generations
1	its a good idea similar thingfor meats
1	its a good idea but ithink there are more important thngs we could focus on
0	its  the first step in creating a long lasting environmentally friendly world. we can't save the planet if we constantly put our need for cheap products ahead of living animals... i mean hae yall seen happy feet?
0	we must or we wont have any fish
0	to maintain thenaturalcycle and food chain to help sustain the plannet meat should be a luxury the emisions are killing home
0	sustainable ways of getting our producewill benefit ourplannet and health
1	we should be more aware of how we treat the sea since water is our most needed resource  if we contaminate it through chemicals or overfish we destroy pretty much ourself. if we could change this i be the first step to a mre sustainablenfuture
1	sytainability esential for food security and ecological diversity on this plat and fir all hunanity
0	because we need to be mindful of our impact and how we treat our oceans
1	i am hopeful due to this question being asked!
1	i dont know. it just seems correct
1	hunans should protect naturual ecosystems in any way they can. hopefully that will include sustinable fishing
2	its important to not get food poisoning.
0	BETTER TASTE MOREKNOWLEDGE OF ORIGIN AND
3	will people stick to it though? that's the real question.people have a tendancy to... stray from rules
1	better for the earth and all round eco systen
1	better than what were currently doing to sea life :/ :(
1	we need to make sure there are still fish in the sea for future generations
1	If we keep fishing unsustainability we might not have fish in the sea.
0	it fosters health and appreciation for land nd s?lf
1	i am gratefulfor the graphic displays which make us aware and activly preparing.
1	need ####### to make it happen
3	if they will be all gone
0	beacause we will kill less fish
1	l think l can help other
0	not only betterfor fish/environment; it tastes better too!
1	commercial and farm fishing are leading to severe fish population depletion and polluting oceans
0	l am excited to go on the plane today.
1	people are nore aware and prepared to pay a bit more for sustainably caught seafood.
1	people thinkif you buy non fresh fish it is better for the environment
1	sustainable fish AND no froze only fresh
1	that would be cool but knowing mankind it may never happen as they will keep on catching until there is nothing left
2	not greatly concerened with fishibg industry
2	more information as to the benefitsof sustainable fishing is better
0	It ensures there will be plenty of fish left for future generations
1	because we'll have fish in the future
2	i dont know anything about this
2	BECAUSE IF FRESH CAUGHT FISH IS CAUGHTPRICES WILL GO UP
0	the oceans will run out of fsh due to mans greed
0	need to maintain the  health of our  oceans for the future
0	we need to think about how our actions now will affect our future
0	we are runnng out of fish.mass fishing is ertrible
0	so the fisheries canbe sustainably managed
3	Poor people may not be able to have fishes anymore
0	this could help not having loss of fish
2	it my will will ey ey
2	ta f u say toe meh
0	sammy bumbum jr ploppied hiv pamts
0	imexcited becausethen all the cool fish can be in the ocean
0	the world is more important and stop whaling in Japan
0	because it is good for our world
0	too be honest its a mongrel mob sieg
0	fishing is destroyibg te oceabs. 70percent of plastic waste is from fishing
0	we should treat this planet like it is the only one we have
1	it will save the limited endangered species!
1	If we want a continued place on this planet we need to all start respecting it and all species
0	I think this is a good idea because we have twelve years to try to fix this mess we have made on Earth. I feel like people will be  willing to spend more money on better food if they can see the outcome of their doings.
0	if we dont then we run the risk of running out of resources all for the sake of a few dollars. we cant eat money.
2	i dont   care because i cant read
1	becaus it is healthier and more sustainable
1	it is already a step in the right direction to be thinking about how tomake the food industry more sustainable
0	we need to move towards a more sustainable future
0	because we cant live without our fishy whanau
1	run out of fish bad idea
1	time to start thinking beyond our own generstion
4	Commercial fishing is responsible for 45 percent of the plastic in the ocean. Just because the fish are sustainable doesn't mean the practise of fishing is. Go vegan to save our ecosystems.
0	sustainability is  more inportant than cheap fish
0	we should all try to live sustainably
1	dont fish at all smh bc by 2050 the ocean wonthave any atall
0	sustainability is essential for the survival of earth ecosystems as a whole
4	because every fish  have a higher risk of becoming exctinct.
0	i think that if we this then if we run ut of some fish we will still have others
0	that it will imrove our fish supply
1	responsible for caring for the earth
1	more economic and helpful for the enviroment
1	I like think this is doable! my only concern is our poorer families
0	overfishig is ahuge problem & fishing nets end up in   the ocean and pollute the environment
1	because people kill fish  that are narly extinked like the lemmon shark peoplecatch it because it is an easy target
2	its fis so it will grow back     like mydad would say tome
0	if it isnt sustainable we shouldnt fish.
0	Over fishing or fishing unsustainably will cause ocean ecosystems to collapse. Moving towards sustainble fishing is a small price to pay to save our oceans.
0	Because it gives me hope that fish may survive on planet earth.
1	nature is more important than humans taste buds
0	because my ante ###### is here in nz yay
0	safer for enviroment and might help global warming since the supermarkets wouldnt want expensive fish dying from plastic polution therefore producing less plastic (hopefully)
0	that pepelhave to be more stsalble and stop litting
0	it keepsthibgs intact for later generations
1	education on the impact of overfishing is now haveing a consumer imact
1	I think that all fresh food should be sourced sustainably
4	no form of current commercial fishing is sustainable. our fishing practicel ike thrawling are disgusting and the by kills are horrible. just stop buying fish period
0	fishing should be reduced to sustain species
1	because the fisher men  can catch more fish
1	because we keep more fish in the water
1	I think they soid stay in the sea for fish men
0	im excited cause im at te papa
4	cause nan wont let go on an e scooter
0	i want to support sustainable fish stocks
0	we nee to look after  the  oceans
0	otherwse the ish stocks will run out.
0	this should be mandatory. fish populations are dramatically decreasing.
1	Fish stocks are a depleting resource and we need to encourage sustainable consumer behaviours if we want fisheries to survive
1	it would hopefully helpsave our oceans
0	So my grandkds can eat fish one day
0	it would become more appreciated to enjoy a meal with fish
1	because this is unrespectable to   fish fish who will desapear soon.
0	so thatwe have more for future generations
0	i think e should be protecting our fish stocks and ban shark finning and bottomtrawling. protect our oceans
1	Over fishing will fuck the eco system

0	i want to knowi can eat fish in the future
1	because it would help us even if it cost more
1	sustainable fishing not only protects the future of our fisheries but also protected speces
1	it would be much better for the environment
0	we are running out of fish and killingother species as we go
1	ideas need support to become real
0	we have a duty to protect our earth and her resources
1	I think thiscould help th fish population greatly.
1	i think it is good because we are saving the population.
1	I  think that this would help the sea ecosystem thrive.
1	ITS A GOOD START FOR A BETTER WORLD.
1	Need a clear indication as to what 'sustainable fishing' is
0	If we eat all the fish there will be no more fish to eat -and thatwould besad
1	bc i think fish e eatshud b free range
3	what does sustainable even mean? i need that defined before i support it
0	cannot sustain our consumption levels with growing populations
2	not bad of it if i earn money to try my best
0	it is a great ideato keep the enviroment balanced
4	homeless people might want a fish but they now cant afoord one
1	eventually it becomes the norm and will be cheaper due to demand. or we could all live even more sustainably and not eatfish at all! Go vegan!
1	a small cost increase inthe short term is worth it to be sure our descendants will still have access to kai moana.
0	i want to minimise how much we mess up the environment. can weleave it in a betterstate?
0	all purchased items should be sustainable
1	the  farming/f®sh®ng prct®c?s n??d t b? h®mn?
1	so we dont use them up.   ###### age#
1	its more fish over the longterm
4	i think it is indangering  them it is not good
1	If they catch fish when the particular spieces are getting lower in numbers then theres none left for anyone else :)
1	we already buy less fish because of the cost and the environmental issues. i want us and our children and grandchildren to be able to purchase and fish for ourselves thirty to fifty years from now
1	are going to change the demand
1	I think thi will benifit people in lots of ways; it will keep our waters filled with fish for tomorrows generations.
0	its better fr the enviroment along with climate crisis
3	we are at a critical stage of our evironmetal crisis and sustaining now may possibly help but more needs to be done to protect the environment and human existance
3	i think it is not ok to eat fish caught from sea cause of all the plastic in the sea
0	it is only rightthat we care for thesea fully in all aspects
1	it needs to happen to save  our fish
1	once the fish haveal been caught there will be none left for us to enjoy. Thereforehaving sustainable fishing will work for not only us but our oceans in the long run
2	i hate fish. they can die
0	Our planet is more important than money
0	need to look after our resources
1	im hopeful that big corporations stop looking into their wallet and start looking at our health and the health of world.
0	the mass depletion in our oceans is concerning. trawling and consuming our ocean wildlife needs to stop and be reflected apon. commerical fishing is evil.
0	Becau the last thing that humanity needs is another extinct animal
0	we should not be plundering our fisheries without knowing the costs to species survival both target species and bycatch.  Consumers want the facts to be able to buy consciously
1	that we should look after are rivers and the fish that live in them
1	becos we shold care about the anmalls not just us
0	It is important to begin to change our mindsets surrounding environmental sustainability.
1	commercial fishing is an unsustainable practice that would be best stopped about 3 decades ago
0	save the oceans. save the planet
1	becuse hopefully i get  to play games
2	cause i dont like fish that much
1	i think thats a great idea
4	Because you have to find the fish  bone when you eat a fish.
0	i want to see my kids live
0	it helps controlthe population of the fish bd ®t w®ll h?lps®st®n th? pln?t fr future generations
0	beasuse it will be fresh and helps  the planet
0	it is good for us and will ensure the poplation of the fish will survive for our future generations
1	We need to protect our native taonga at all costs
0	this is a good idea i mean would uwant no fish in the futre or slightly less money
2	I don't really care about the environment.
1	because people with all cost will be able to benefit from this  nutritinally and healthily
1	we need to protect our sealife for  generations to come
1	that  our sealife  is already under  threat  from plastic  we  need  to do more  to  protect  the  fish  for  our  future.
0	it will help people take steps to look after world !!!
1	i am hopeful because this goal could be accived because it is not that hard
0	i think that it will be good because people no longer have to actively seek out sustainable foods.
0	coz  already have a lot of animals extinct coz of us. as the smartest animal we have the responsbiity to protect them.
0	They have the power to ensure sustainability. They are the interface with the consumer and therefore shuld be responsible.
1	i think that the  fish can be living because   they have the right to be like every other fish that can live in water
1	it would preserve our endangered marine wildlife
0	if its notsustainable there will be nofish for ourgrandchildren
1	we should not ruin the ecosystem that is the basis for our living on this planet
1	we need to take responsibility for our over consumption of the world in general.
2	because  we would have to pay more.
4	I think fish should not be caught in thefirst place. They are not forc onsumption and  therefore we should not eat them at all.
1	because it will be better for us and it would be also might be better forthe enviroment as well
2	the heat death will take it all anyway
1	YOU NEED TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY INCENTIVISED FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON BOARD. WE CAN DO ITTHOUGH!
2	because its nota big problem for me
2	bcause its nt a big problem because i dont like fis.
1	I think we should care more for our nature and relise that we are not the only people in this world
1	i hope this happens because it will be better for the fish
0	becauseit will help endangered animals recover
0	it will replenish the oceans eventually.  but we have to do it now .otherwise it will be too late   it probably nearly is.....
0	it is good for the environment
1	Our resources are finite and in need of conservation yet how will this shift be regulated and who will be liable -the supermarkets or the fishermen?
0	BECAUSE it will help our  environment healthy
4	the fish ned to stay in the whater
2	i dont like youif you read this
1	i think this will benefit our oceans future and create a betterenvironment for Aotearoa
0	that im seeing my sister for the first time since easter
3	There should be no commercial fishing of any kind.
4	Because they are taking fish from their homes and killed and eaten.
4	BAN COMMERCIAL FISHING....KEEP OUT ASIAN CONSORTIUMS
0	people need to be made aware of the cost to our planet. Raising prices will make the popuation take note and begin an appreciation to how we source our food and theeffect it has on our planets future.
3	fish will be more expensive and that gives me a sad
1	we if dont then the waters will get over fished
4	moke aku matoa hony fa toma ah
4	moko tof eh iwaco ma nasa
3	if we keep dumping waste into the ocean we will kill out all the fish.
2	we catch our own fish and dont buy them ever anyway
2	i thiink they should do this case fish is yunny
1	would be great if supermarkets cared enough to do this
0	because i am going on camp
1	fish need to be fresh to eat othrwse your most likly to get sick
0	more sustainable. better the enviornment in thelong run
1	hopeful it will happen but people are greedy
1	because in the long run if we caught sustainable and enviromentaly our fish will trive more
0	it will save our marine life and give future generations a chance to have a sea life. if we destroy this now they will never get the chance. fish are important part of our eco system. without we all die.
0	The damage done by us to our  oceans is grave. we  as consumers vote with our dollars and if we REALLY want to 'save our oceans' this is one of the first changes we need to take responsibility for
1	we need to preserve our fish stocks.
0	i think its good because sustainably caught fish help us get better at savng the enviroment. companies like sealord have already got a move on.
0	definitly because all da fish will die and we wont have any cool fish
3	we have let so many beautiful animals head to extinction
0	it is better for our future
0	because it is the right thing to do

0	it is  important to save the fish
1	I think that pepole shod stop yousing plastic
0	it reduces the pressure on breeding fish populations allowing thema chance to reproduce before being caught
1	sustainabity of the marine ecosystem. it's a concept humanty can intellectualise about but we struggle to make any real progress on.
0	we must look after our oceans to sustain life
0	Sustainable produce is important to ensure there is an environment for future generations to enjoy
0	If we dont have a sustainable way of fishing then we wont have fish to buy in the future
1	protecting our wildlfe is more important than creating cheaper deals for  people at the cost of the ecosystem. our desire for cheaper  food does not and should not be considered to hold more importance than the marine lifes existance.
0	its a must in this day and age
2	it needs to be affordable and sustainable
3	becaus in a long time all the fish and marine life will be gone.
1	i think that this would be a new start and a better future for our sea
0	We shouldn't overfish because it has negative impacts on our marine fish populations and fishing sustainably will be better for the future! We need to rethink sustainability in industies in NZ
1	i like fishng and i dont wantit gone
1	Consumers will think more carefully before buying fish and hopefully eat less of it.
1	its a good idea but unlikelyto happen
0	whatevr it takes t get our oceans and fish stock halthy agin
1	sustainable and balanced ecosystems are vital to the ongoing success of both fisheries and waterlife alike. its much easier to prevent issues than fix them after the fact
1	Anything that is sold should also account for environmental costs in its price. We need to ensure that there will be enough fish for every generation to come.
0	I think that we should all do our job to keep the amount of fish we have in the sea. This ensures a supply for a long time ahead of now.
0	i think it would be dam great for the environment
1	people should be more thoughtful about where their produce comes from.
0	because it is better for the environment and wildlife
0	it will help fish recover from overfishing
1	i think it helps other  people eat more fish but if they dont we wont eat that much fish any more so i think its  gd ®d?
2	i dont know what this is
1	Eventually all our food needs to be sustainably produced.
1	becase then our oceab wildlife can carry on thriving
0	change only really happens when an idea tips into the mainstream. As banning single use plastic bags has taught us supermarkets are a good tipping point.
0	because it means more fish can be in the ocean
0	because it is yummy food if it is cooked
0	bcause it is good for the  environment and it is yummy when cooked.
0	We will run out of fish and in the future we wont   have fish and the fish die
1	that we can be better and its good tosee us moving towards solutions
0	we need to stop overfishing and protect biodiversity in the ocean
0	i dont want anymore species to go extinct
0	We need toprtectthe seas for the next geniration
1	i think we should do this to keep the fishhappy and alive
0	it is good for the whales and other sea animals that eat fish. They would not survive without the fish.
4	I think it's cruelty to our ocean wildlife.
2	follow me on ins trinity.kingi9   suppppppppppppp
0	it is great for the environment
4	we shouldnteat animals. animals are not food
2	THERE ARE A LOT OF FISH
0	THE EATHUAKE HOUSE IS REALLY FUN DROP COVER HOLD  IS THE KEY I CANT WAIT TO EXLORE MOR!!!
0	i think you can make the earthquake house rock waymoreharderso its more funner!!!!!!!
0	because i am staying  at my grandmars
0	we have run out of time yet politicians and business people still think things have to be consideredfrom a financil poit of view.
0	it good to sell fish in the supermarket
0	I feal exited because we NEED fish in the ocean
0	because otherwise the fish will go exstnt
4	i lost a round of fortnite
3	i think bananas are killing usin secret
1	the future is bright and we are resilient
1	the supermarkets shoukd never ever sell non-sustanble .they shoud only sell thriving fish becase then the fish theysell that is not sustainable will perish
1	this is great step in the right direction! But if we really want to become our most sustainable selves then we should aim to consume fish minimally or not at all. Sustainably raised and/or caught fish still require lots of energy that could be used somewhere else much more efficiently.
1	that it would be good if we did that because it means we can keep breeding so even more fish will come.
0	because otherwise we wont have all the kai moana that we should i the world
0	because otherwise we wont have as nuch kai moana that we should in the world
0	because you guys have alot of intriguing historical things on display
0	we could help fix the oceab
1	i would like to think the younger generation should care for their future
1	i think ts because te supermarkets will refuse thedeas and the people too due to the expenses
2	i have no idea what's going on in thiworld
0	we should get our food source sustainably whether its fish or anything else. humans do not own the world we are merely temporary caretakers
1	because the fish will be bette
0	because we are at te papa
0	BECAUSE THE FOOD S BETTER FRESHER
1	Mku ake he tuku mihi tenei ki ng kaimahi o Te Papa n o koutou tino kaha kite haumarui ng taong nei tino ataahua
0	i love te papa o much
0	becuse u use your own bag and don't use plastic
4	becusse people use plastic so every one ruse rduce and recycle
1	If we keep sustainable fish they will not go extinct for our future.. abd ur children may experience the wonders of the sea the best they can
4	socially nd environmentaly irresponsible..and short sighted. supermarkets can make a difference much faster than individuals.  which oe will be the first to lead by example...new world countdown pac and save?.. or maybe it will always just be about the$$$
1	because then the fish will stay together andgive us more food
3	it can also be worringbecause it will be more money
0	you get a bigger fish to eatand not a smaller one so you will get healthyer
2	somepeople just won't care if they get a smaller fish or if they get a bigger fish butit costs more.
1	i think that this is a auwesome place but it gets very   boring after awhileim sorry or my negativaty butit is true great jobsokeep up thegood work
1	it's good for the nature of course. but not for families wwih poor income
0	bro its just plain common sense. like forreal...
4	Fish shouldn't be eaten they should be left in the ocean rivers and lakes.
4	u shoudent sell fish at all because they are a animal
4	there is no such thing as sustainable fishing. google captain paul watson. go vegan.
4	THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FISH. THE OCEANS WILL BE DRAINED UNLESS DRASTIC CHANGES AREMADE. BE KIND. LIVE WELL. GO VEGAN
1	i would prefer nottoeat fish if it is not sustainable.our fish.our world aremoreimportant than me eatingfish
2	cause i am only## so i want to live life free
0	because if we sell  fewer fish we will have fish and we won't make fish extinct and we will have fish still in the sea.
1	Animal produce should only be caught and sold if it does not impact the ecosystem. This should be a sustainable process
1	people need to recognise the value of resources
0	only selling sustainable fish means i will get to eatfish when i grow up
1	This has been a long time coming.
1	if you're so concerned about the cost of safely  caught fish than adopt a  cheaper plant based diet. we cannot continue our  destructive eating habits.
0	it is very cool and awesome in here..cant wait for thenext time..
0	because that means we will have lots more fish
1	i think it should be more yum
3	that we will not be eating fish and i love fishand if the fish died therewill be no fish
0	because fish is really good foryou.
0	it is the right thing to do
0	the ocean is delicate and without it we couldnt live
2	idon't car because i like fish they are yummy and are good for u.
1	hopefully human kind can take heed and nuture our fish bird and nature forthe longevityof all
0	all we can eat is righthere
1	We need to be kinder to the animals and not take more than we really need. The world needs support and aroha!
0	There are many environmental challenges to face--anything to help restore balance.
1	it is a great idea but it might not happen
1	I hope that the government can put in a law for the quaility and the type of fish being caught so that we can enjoy the fish in our ocean while staying safe and not getting sick
0	i think the world is beautiful
0	because it demonstrates  that we take our environmentalresponsibilities seriously
1	would be nice but people got to eat as well
0	without ocean life we are probably stuffed
0	because the market fr fresh fish is so satrated
0	its important toprotect the sustainability of ourfisheries
0	I think that its important to use sustainable food consumtion practices to preserve our natural environment
0	we gotta look after nature so we all survive
0	internalises a cost that ise xternalisd
0	If we dont take care of what we are doing now with food procurring processes.the next generation will have even less to enjoy and live for. We should be leaving the world as we found it.not worsening it.
1	i hope that this idea happens as itis important for the environment
1	it is better for the enviroment to catch wild fish because wheb you farm fish it can case the water to get poluted and f one virus spreads it can infect all of them and cause a big problem
1	we nned to sustain in order for them yo survive
0	this is the only way to secure our environment for future generations
0	GIVE ME COOKIES NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / 100000000000  cookies

0	this could help save our panet. everything is going to cost us something to save our planet.nthings free so we most put money aside and save our word so our children can live in this beauitful word
3	we shoud not eat any fish
0	We need to make sure fish are available for future generations. ALL fish should be fished sustainably.
0	Because some caught fish are becoming extinct.
1	we need to save our oceansforthefuture generations
1	because we will cause a fish collapse otherwise
0	finally we are beginning to see a bigger picture - that a 'thriving economy' does not equal health and happiness for everyone. i am excited to see a happy country and environment rather than heavy pockets!!
1	we should only fish what we need
4	i do not think that is a good idea.
1	i think we are closer to the poin tof no return thanwe thought. any and every opertunityto mae the world more sustainabeshould be taken.
4	fish price will go up no one will buy it and it will go to waste
1	it is better for our enviorment
3	because  people always kill fish when they catch them
1	beceuse it  is good for the enviroment
1	that itwill be better for the long term
3	im worried how they put there facts across

1	because the fishare imporrtant to the world
3	big country leaders don't care about the rest
0	As we do not want our native species to be harmed because of unsustainable fishing. We also do not want to have to introduce pest species again because of fishing all of the commercial fish.
0	so the fish dont die out

3	Not everyone is honest and there are people who can easily lie and say something's caught sustainably. But what's stopping them from lying?

0	there is not an infinite amuont of fish in the seaso we shuld use them wisely
0	tht this is a good ideaso that there is more fish in he sea
0	i think it is good tomakemore fish then more seafood
4	this should already be happening... but really we shouldn't be fishing at all because it is crewl
0	quota licences and scoopnets only for whitebait
3	wits simple. we need to stop eating fish. the majority of plastics in our ocean are from fishing. if you care about the earth. dont eat fish.
3	We should already be sustainibly fishing any fish we do catch. It is worrying that we are only just starting to do this. Also we just shoudn' t be eating fish
4	because sustainability is key to a good environment
0	it might solve my life problems
3	i am scared that amamals will die out
0	Sustainable fish means  a more sustainable living environment for our people. We need to save Papat®nuku at all costs; Even if it means going through the hassle of catching more sustainable fish.
1	we need to make sure that we have enough fish to sustain the future generations.
3	I'm scared that all the animals will die because of us.We need to do someting about this.
4	I do not like what supermarkets are doing  and make more traps.MAKE MORE TRAPS
1	i think that it would be better for the environment but the supermarkets would probably not do it
0	This is good because the fish are important to the sea life. The fish help the coral grow.
1	By having sustainable fish supplies we become more aware of our impact and have to control our markets  Not eating and living selfishly
0	I think itis a good idea  because other wise we will catch to many fish but we won't eat it all and we will waste bait and kill to many inoccent fish. I also feel a bit angry because we rally shoudn't be eating that much fish anyway but overal I amexited
0	I think  it is a good idea because I love the ocean and all the fish in it.
1	Because then there will be fish for the future
1	supermarkets should sell sustainable fish because think about five people you your children grand children great grand children and your great great grand children
1	its better for us and its safer. we will get no diseased fish and it will hope fully taste better.
0	because its saiving our planit and its tasty
1	friends dont let friends eat farmed fish
1	it's better for us as well as the fish. New Zealand's waterways are getting more and more polluted and this will help.
1	it will be better for us and hopefully taste better
2	because my mum buys fish somewere else
1	we should look after the planet because otherwise we are all going to die
1	its because my name is nothing
1	because i think that if we try and we all help outwe can save our planet
1	because it will help to sustain the fish population
1	:P because its good to have fish around and the fish population will not be extinct any time soon.  fish is a big source of food and it would be TERRIBLE not having any. imagine not tasting GLORIOUS fish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	i think its beneficial for the sustainability   of our nz waters
3	why should it cst more.  cant governments be able to keeps the same
0	it should not be expensive when it is caught and processed here
0	it is better  for the environment
0	fish are cooljust i wouldnt want it to be more exspensive
1	It means that we will have more fish for the future.
3	because we should't take more than is being replaced
0	because we need the fish and to care for the ocean
1	because we need to look after New Zealand
2	i am a child so i dont do you grocery shopping:)
0	once they ae gone they are gone.
1	otherwise were using too much energy
0	i hink pursesein fishing is an unsustainable fishing practice whick kills breeding stock of fishes
0	we need to look after our future generations and ensure they can have what we are our parents have had
4	I  THINK ITS OK TO NOT KILL ANY  FISH
0	we want fish in the future
1	people are ignorant and will do anything for  money and are blind to the fact that the fish population is decreasing rapidly
1	that is all they should sell
1	without sustainable fishing the oceans will die
0	it is wise to protect our future food surce
1	because i dont think they would do it but it would be a good idea anyway
0	we have to think of our futue and prtect our natural resurces.
0	i want to be able to eat fish that can reproduse itself
0	my conspriacyis that ##### and ###### are datingits  been confirmed #######
1	because if this happens that means were giving the ocean timet thrive
1	should give the oceans time to replenish + i don't wanna support businesses that just exploit exploit exploit + a lot of other reasons why is there no comma on this machine
1	we have a more betefull plays
0	because we have a responsibility tobsustain our environment
2	because i dont know anything about this topic
0	the fish will be nicer and there will be more for the futer
0	itis totally awesome that supermarkets are  not selling plastic bags anymore

1	i think that selling any type of meat more expensive will put people off buying it which will make differenceto the amount of meat grown and consumed so there is less effect on the land
1	It will lead to a brighter future.
1	Becuse it could lead to a brighter future.
3	im  worried because  one day my pants will rip
1	because i want the sea to be happy
0	it's a good idea. don't make the prices too high.
0	........ whyshould you talk to me im not in this world yet
0	we need to play sone fortnite
1	because fish wont be extinct when i am a grown up
1	becuse when i am an adult there will still be fish in the sea
0	we ought to eat fish less often but more responsibly
1	weshold care about where the food e eat comes from. We need to be sustainable so we leave enough for our tamariki.
1	i think this is hopeful because i like ###
2	becaus i dont eat fish and its already cost way to muchso dont care
1	we should all think carefully about the fish we buy and consume..... we will wipe out fish species soon just from our own greed...
1	then u dont kill small fish and then u wont get reefs and rock in nets
0	i think that they should only fish where there are alot of fish because if they fish where there arnt so many they may run out
1	it will mean the fish won't run out.
1	I think they should because then the fish will go extinct and then we will have less food for later generations.
1	that there will be fish to eat future generations
1	the sea is overfished and at the moment they only sell about 6 different species when there are plnty of others toeat
2	I dont really eat fish much so we dont buy it
3	sub to ##### ###### ###### ######
4	no one is subbing to #####
1	we need to do this to protect the environment from over fishinh
1	this will preserve fish species and the marine environment
1	becuseit could meaan a beter futre
2	because food is alredy expensive. the price of the food need to be balanced in order to live .
1	we cant overfish however the price of food in general is already very high.
0	that will be good for us
2	fish is fish it all taste the same if u get the same fish
2	i hate fish so who gives
1	i think it would do good for the world :)
1	cus I don't want t break the food chain
1	i think it is a good intention but wont be very profitable
1	Sustainable fishing is important to ensure the future of such a resource yet I am doubtful that it will be implemented soon enough
0	so that we have fish forever
0	so that if people like fish they can eat it fora long time
1	Because its better for the planet and us
1	I am hopeful because it will save the seas and we will have fish forever!
1	we dont want to hurt our fish because it could effect everything else in the community
1	cause  then it wont hurt any of the other sea animals
3	we should be supporting our locally caught fish
0	fish shoul stay in the water.  not nice to eat
1	becase it can help the enviromentand change things
0	i have had a great day

0	we have to look after tangaroa because he gives us so much
0	because they are aso living beings
4	i think humans sould  more food that is cheap
2	well stell have hell lot of  food
4	there is no need to eat animals. let them live their ife like we live our own in peace
4	why i am angry is because it is not nice to kill animals because the animals won't get a lot of life
1	The fish will live a happier life
1	there will be more fish in the sea
0	there will be more fish in the sea
1	We need fish inthe ocean to keepthe foodcycle going and so we can continue to live sufficently.
0	so that the food cycle can countinue and sharks whales and dolphins have food to eat and dont go extinect
1	We need marine animals to survive also
2	fish geteen i like fish kill more fish so i can eat more fish tt deserve to get eaten.
1	because its more respectful and responsiable
4	i don't want people to fish
0	we must do this to protect our marine ecosystems. We're not the only ones relying on the fish!
2	im not the one buying food
3	We have now encoached to fishing in the Ross Sea in antarctica because we have overfished everywhere else. WE URGENTLY NEED TO REDUCE OUR FISH CONSUMPTION
1	g'day mate it's ya boy ships ahoy
1	as long as thereis a clear undertanding of what a sustainable fishery is. the current plunder of the oceans needs to stop. the NZ GOVERMENT could start bysupporting true marine protection zones
4	because i dint like eating fish
0	grandcids will have fish to eat when grown up
3	the fish have to be caught before they are sold.  even if they are sustainablycaught.  theyare wasted if nobodybys them.
0	unfair for future gens & important fr the future of ocean food chains
1	we should only eat what we can sustain
2	because otherwisete fish will take over the earth
1	it is a dear idea as we need to think well
0	we should be mindful of extinction possibilities
0	we should be concious  of maintaining resources for future generations and bearing thte rue cost of resources and adjusting our cnsumption and business practicesto match
0	this is unavoidable to achieve global sustaibability
3	It would be unfortunate if the price of fish increased so as to be unaffordable for the  average household. They could resort to less nutritious foods and/or cheaper alternatives such as fast food.  The unintended outcome could therefore be worse health for NZers and worse for the environment (increased packaging associated with fast food)
3	Catching some fish/seafood might be all right to the population but lots of people like eating creatures in the sea
0	this helps maintain the balance of the breed of fishes
0	because  i am at TE PAPA
1	Good idea. BUT. We should see where lower income households come into the picture. This is because people and families may turn to cheaper unhealthier food instead of sustainably caught fish. I also belive this should be a global effort in order to make a greater environmental impact.
1	because i am inte papa and  sharing mystuff
1	Because it is hopeful for the unsustainablefisherys
1	must be sustainable whatevr the cost
0	we shkd hv nre fshtgatbdkn xnt XDXD
0	because it will insure we have fish for longer
0	well its a new option that sounds cool
3	Can we really trust that fish on sale is sustianaably caught
4	even though we have food we aretaking the life of the sea creatures especciallythe fish. I would prefer other foods
3	its bad to take the fishs lives. I would feel bad for them
4	because people are using plastic and palm oil
4	supermarkets should have their autonomy respected and not restrained
1	I am hopeful because it will save the seas.
1	best idea for the future of the ocean
0	because there is to much  over fishing and this could solve  it
0	because it means there are more fish for others
1	i think it could be a good idea to reduce over fishing
0	I think it is a good idea because then you are basicley a super hero. So helpme save the world!
3	so many birds  in danger or dispeared
1	it would be good for the environment.and will help recover depleting resources in the enviroment
0	we only have one ocean make  a change for humanity
0	with the crisis of our f®sh it is so important that we protect them.  the least we can do is be sustainable
1	we are hopeful for a forest and a amazing planet we should all be greatful for are land and creatures on it thank you.
1	it will be goodif the fish are not all gone.
1	because companys can just say that they are sustainable but could be lying no one will know. thats why i am hopeful that we can do it
1	i do not want the fish to be gone
1	it can be better for the enviroment and can lack exstinction of the fish that are suffering. it is more convenient for them to  live and create generations for the future.
1	i think it is ok because people have actually caught the fish
1	well if there arn't any fish we'll soon go extinct ... who wants that? ihopethat the fishermen will understand and only fish sustaiably thereshould be a law all over the world tostop unsustainble fishers
0	keep more fish in the water for future generation
2	i get fresh fish straight from the ocean cause my dad is a fisherman so i never get fish from the supermarket anyway
1	i thib this would be good as the fact i dont like the factof animals going extinct
0	Sustainability is the key to encouraging a healthy future for the environment and the people
0	we need to keep our ocean balanced as the micro plants in the water provide us with half of our oxygen
1	its good because you do not have to kill the good fish yum yum
0	it is better for the world
3	it means that the environment is being looked after better but if the fish is more expensive no one would buy it so that market would collapseanyway
1	I think some things may be too late to save but we ca still save others.
2	i dont eat fish so i dont care
1	because if you keep killing one kind of fish then there will be no more then its onto the next type.
0	it will take a ong time to change mutli national supermarkets. fish should besustiably caught but they will cost alot more
1	if we dont hopeful we will lose our mind
0	cause it will increase the fish population
1	i think it shuld be stoped
0	that we will be able to increse the wild marine life without trail fishing
0	its a good thing that you like the thing you will do
0	without replacing wild stock of fish every one we take brings their numbers down
0	this is a must. why would we not. remove money and its about the future
0	I think people should be doing this so there are going to be more fish.
2	if we let them be free the only thing that will change is we will not be able to eat sea food. and its okay because we have soo much other food.
0	we need to be sustainabe in every part of our lives!
0	to see wellingtn and my cuzin
1	we all have to take steps to do he right thing for our world
1	If we don't protect the oceans we won't have fish in the future
0	this is important for the future of our planet and our people
0	because we can use technolagy for good
1	Because the fish that are not so plentiful will not die out
1	I think that the fish that are not so plentiful will not die out.
1	The Oceans need time to recover from driftnet fishing but sustanable fish farms have pollution issues unqiue to them as well.
1	its the right thing to do
1	depleting fish stock caused by over fishing
3	supermarkets should be held accountable ://
1	Cost s an ever changing and subjective thing. The fish and ocean aer harder to look after
0	i  will not see a  scary picture
1	Because that way there are still fish and we won't make them extinct/harm their populations
4	i think it is a dumb thing todo
0	that it s a good idea because it is better for everything
4	Why are we eating fish in the first place? If we are so intent on being sustainable here is an idea - DONT EAT THE FISH THAT ARE MEANT TO STAY IN THE SEA
4	We don't require  the consumption of meat (fish or otherwise) to survive and thrive in this world. Vegan numbers are growing exponentially every day. We will continue to prove that animal products are no longer required or moral to take innocent lives for. Join us.
0	everyone has a responsibility to help us create asustaiable future
0	i dont trust fish.they are a bit fishy
1	i think this is a good idea because i really like nature and animals and i am really worried aboutwhat could happen to them if we keep killing them or it
1	because i want to eat fresh fish without any rubbish nside it
1	because otherwise fish will be a food of thepast
0	I AM HOPEFUL THAT PEOPLE SELL SUSTAINABLE PRODUCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	we should ban unsutainable fishing. 2 fish in the sea please
1	The fishing industry is one of the most polluting and profitable industries in the world. Making the fish more "sustainable" isnt't the solution but reducing the accessibilityof the fish therefore reducing the amount of fish caught is the truly more sustaibable option.
0	because there will be less extinct animals
0	because   it will help the envroment
1	I think it' ll be great
1	We need to stop overfishng our precious ocean which is also a big global problem. If we keep eating fish that's unsustainably caught then there will be no more fish for us in the future due to overfishing. We will completely ruin the ecosystem of our mana.
0	it's the right ting to do for consevation
0	it is a better option for both parties
4	no one should eat fish i am a vegetarian
0	fish rights!!! fish deserve to have equal rights!!!!! SAVE FISH YAAAAS
0	we should all be making some effort for the future.
1	sustainability is a fundamental part of longevity.
0	it is the right thing to do
1	better protect the rest of the ocean and the turtles
1	I like to think our ocean is being protected
1	because it will be a better world and more comfortable for vegeterians.
1	that it should happen but it is a very unlikely event
3	because what if we dont have any birds left.
1	because that is how i feel
1	it would help the eco sestime
0	so there are fish left for future generations to enjoy
0	should have happened a long time ago
0	it is the only right thing to do
0	save  our at risk marine life eg snapper
1	beacuse it is better for you and your health and my diddy dog yo wat up do u now da wae
0	we need to change how we think
1	it may not be affordable for some
1	if the fishibg industry begins to become sustainable not nly can we protect the future of the economy but we can als protct the future of the planet and of humanity
0	i am excted because im in wellington for my holidays
0	It give indangered fish a chance to reproduce.
1	because fish is a good sourse of protien
1	most consumers would value clear knowledge of where their food comes from and what its impact is
0	We need to preserve the fishstocks for generations to come
0	If we only catch sustainably caught fish then it'll give endagered fish achane to reproduce.
2	i like any type of fish there yummy
1	so that the fish do not become extinct
3	we need to educate peope more  start withkids
0	we need to protect our fsh stocks world wide and help some species regenerate and become sustainable t catch
1	I  hope that their carry on with this idea
0	it will help sustain our resources for the future.
0	leaves more fish for me to catch
0	The current fishibg situation is unsustainable
2	i stole r mum last night
1	because it shows hope for the future.
0	we need totake goodcare  of our planet and natural resources
1	i hope this will enable fish at risk of extinction will survive
0	I just wabt things to be better  and sustainable
0	because we clean up our mess
1	hopefuly it would not have plastic in its system
1	we need to accept we cant just always expect everything to go our way - this is another way to get better at sharing
0	cause its better for the environment
4	we are runing out of fish
4	we shouldntbe eating any more fish or animals until we have a better way of caring for them and their waste
1	as long as they dont find nemo
1	so we can look after the nature
0	because it s good to keep our oceans thriving
0	bcause there will be species saved
1	we will otherwise run out of fish
0	because it will mean that i might eat nice fish in the future
1	supermarkets and grocery manufacturers should also stop using plastics.
0	if we do it will inprove our oceans and other species not only fish
0	because it is better for the fish population
0	i thnk that it is good that fish are being treated well before they die
0	it sounds like an amzing idear and it willhelp our fish and wildlife
0	we need to look afterour planet and be more cobciously aware
0	fish tastes awesome but we need to be mindful of what we eat
0	fish tastes ausome but   we need to be mindful about  edangered species
1	supermarketsshouldnt sell ANY fish. home catch only. we need to protect our beautiful marine habitats from destruction.
0	we should cease commercial fishing of kai moana and only reintroduce if truely sustainable methods can be utilised.
0	who will decide whats sustanable? we need to understand more
1	gives speces a chance to live
0	its a small step for a better environment
1	it may create an appreciation for fish
1	I Think it is a good idea to eat sustainable fish as they wont run out. Additionaly the chips tase nicer too.
4	animals should not be our source of food. we should understand that by trying to survive killing is not the answer in any possible way to no live on earth. through other sources we can easily learn how to survive. by choosing easy or simlple ways to us we are just destroying.
0	we dont want to run out of fish

0	to avoid extinction. all creatures have a fundamental purpose in the ecosystem. to take away anything is to take away from the correct working of our planets dependencies...
2	its eww gross i dont eat it why its just a fsh right!
0	it supports the local economy and encourages sustainable harvesting
0	ethical consumption can only take us so far if there is still financial incentive for corporations to produce unethically.
1	if we can define sustainability precisely Then worthy to try
0	because all our nimals are dying
1	i dont know i just am guess what im getting a walk in coset i know this is so irelivant i just wanted to share the news
1	we need to protect our ocean and its wildlife
1	yes becouse it is the thing right to do
4	fish is one kind of sniml living it has its own life dont kill them
1	I think any action against climate change is a good one.
1	I HOP DAT FIS COS ###
1	I  AM  MYSELF AND I  LIKE  BEING MYSELF
0	i am excited about looking at this cool excibition the 2nd time and also i can trick or prank people.
0	I feel so excited about the benefits of sustainably caught fish. I have been waiting for this for years. It makes me bubble with excitement knowing that people can get inspired to buy sustainably caught fish. I hope that other people are inspired
0	For the future this is a great move for New Zealand
4	OH SHUT BIG NOSE YOU DONUT CHEERIOSARE YO HAGILICOUS FATTTTTTY
0	This is a really cool idea and improves NZ conservation
2	just dont eat fish at all
1	we should be eat safe food
0	that we need to thibk bout the future f whanau to come...these knds choices are the nly nes to make for our moko
4	becaus i love fish in chips and eatting fish in chips
0	we love the idea of it
1	its a great idea but im not sure humans care enough to actualllydo it!
1	cause we eat lots of fish if we do that our ocean will be more butifull to snorkell or dive in
0	Because without fish in the sea the whoe ecosystem will be uprooted abd that will refect not only in the sea but on land as wel
1	Because we need to save some fish which is near extinction.
3	Sadly no fisheries can be truly sustainable based off all the other negative ecosystem impacts. Sustainable fishing is a target we are yet to acheive.
0	i think they should leave small fish in the sea because we can let the small fish grow up and also we should leave some big ones to just in case their the sall fishes mum or dad.
1	hopefull that we can replenish fish stocks
3	If  they catch the baby fish thier parents will b worried
3	i have more pokemon crads than u ########
3	i have more pokemoncards than u #######
0	then the earth will be more protected
1	because its a good idea to help ocean resources
0	because the environment can regrow the fish
1	the fresher the fish the beetter it is
1	i think that it is important to do such things asit will be healthier for us and for nature(why are there no commas?!)
1	we dont want our oceans to get extinct
1	Because I believe that fish should be seen as a luxury instead of a necessity.
1	i am hopeful beacuse i care about everyone. andthe earth .
1	we dont want our oceans to go extinct
3	no one is making a change yet!!!
1	hopefully people start to reconise the plastic pollution and damage that people are doing. try to be more sustainable new zealand. if you want the future to change
3	mico beads should be band all over Aoteroa!
1	the problem with sustabably caught fish is that there are bearly any fishing companies that fish sustaibably. Polluted seas are mainly because of fishing gear rom the companies. Most of the ocean is filled nets; lines; hooks and rope because fishing companies aren't  trying hard enough to fish sustainably. If big worldwide fishing companies CARED and DID fish sustaibably then yes. Supermarkets should buy sustaibably caught fish.
0	because we are consumng mre than we need and the ocean snt this bottomless resurce for human gain
1	it will be good fo the environment but it is hard to put into reality
1	i think things need to change.
0	this encourages a safer and more environment friendly way of living.  it will be worth the cost when we make a change for the better
0	i think it would be a better idea
4	not sustainable at all. we loveplaying god. motherearthwill teach us a lesson soon. people are stuid
2	it doesnt matter i eat  ###### ### not ###
1	because it will save our oceans
0	to keep our fish stocks in the ocean
2	the world will end soon anyway
1	I think that it will be better for the environment  and the economy.
0	i think it would be a great idea
0	i think it would be a great idea
1	sustainability means a hope for a better future. for our future generations and palent.
0	i feel like this idea is beneficial for future generations and in the long run provide a  more sustainableenvironment
2	I don' care because  i don't mind if it happns or not
0	it means when i go fishing there will be more fish
0	it is inportant to protect the sea life
1	its incredibly important to lookafter our environment for future generations. i an worried that we will be toolate.
1	i think NZ is changing its ways when t comes to sustainability. but A LOT more still needs to be done lets be the trend setters for the rest of the world!!
0	as for the sustainability of nz. we need to be able to find a way to effectivly harvet fish in a way that wont caue harm to native populations and still allow them to grow in poplulation size.
1	Because sustainability is important and so are fish
0	it would be great for saving our oceans
1	kaimoana is so important to our economy. The supernarkets will benefit eventually
1	it needs supermarkets to take a lead on this. People will frequently buy cheaper products if they have the choice despite the environmental damage.
0	because that way they wont get exctincted in the ocean and here will be more fishies
1	IF they were hunted more because  they were cheap fish would be in danger.
1	we should only source clean and ethicly sourced products to keep everything efficient. Shouldnt matter if things cost more as long as were eating clean and not added or modified products
0	Te toto o te tangata he kai; te oranga o te tangata he whenua me te moana
0	trawlers should be banned! Fish are a finite resource and should be caught by local fishermen not big companies making a buck. We need to be better kaitiaki for our land and resources.

1	we all have a responsibility to ensure that we live sustanable lives to protect our envirnment fir future generations.
1	it isnt just up to the consumer to make the right decision because studies have shown that even if they have good intentions going in the wallet usually speaks louder.

4	i want   look after the  fish we want  to     eat at te same time but it dosent mean harm them   eat enything but that
0	it will help species of fish not go extinct. for that reason it is a good idea
1	as much as i would love for that to be a thing; it is possible that our native fish czould go extinct. but if it were possible wouldn't that be the dream.

3	fish dnt care how theyre caught

0	the idea of sustainably caught fish is exciting because ofthe idea oftakingfishfrom theocean withouttaking to much from the environment
1	so there is food available for the next generation
1	i dont want to talk about it
1	It's costing the ocean badly and it needs to stop.
1	more marine reserves also to repenish fish  stocks
1	less chance of nativefish going extinct
0	because fishing debris is one of the most prominent forms of ocean litter and fixing this would positively affect ocean significantly.
1	because us humans are having better fish to eat
1	So that we can preserve our oceans and marine life for future generations and improve the quality of the seafood that we eat.

4	DON'T KILL THE BLOB SISH OR PUFFER FISH
0	its a good way to  care for our future
1	I think that now people  are becoming  more aware and they are doing everything they possibly can sustainably. But personally I reckon people should have started to make these changes about 70 years ago. Then the problem wouldn't have escalated  tothis point.
0	oceans are under threat and need protection
0	oif people use cemicals in food people would buy them and eat them and get sick and the bug could  spread all around the world   and  th?n p?l? w®ld tk? lts f m?d®c®n? t g?t r®d f th? b®g nd y® w®ld g?t s s®ck tht y® w®ld d®? nd ®f ?v?ryn? d®?d then the world would be  empty and people would'nt have time to create a medicine to make people better.
0	i think this is a great.
1	outlook is very dire if we dont change
0	People are the  worst predators to animals. Some play a vital  role in our diet but we shouldnt consume them at such a rate. WHOS WITH ME?
1	ideally the costs would not increase substantially for the average consumer as many people would struggle to afford this. i still believe  that this is a good idea as it is essental hat food production progresses to more sustainable methods in all areas.
0	so then future generations can enjoy kai  moana like those before us
0	less rare fish species will get hunted
1	If we do not fish sustainably we will not have any more fish to fish up
0	It is better for the planet
1	I think the governmentshould havecreated Kermadec Sanctuary but ####### and the Greens sold out to ####### ###### and now the country is screwed. Selfish politicians who dont care about sustainability. Its the governments responsibiity. They need to step up instead of expecting businesses to do their job. National cared more. The current government are idiots.

1	because the fish is being sorced sustainably
3	am wOriied bcayse i HATE the envronmentcand LIMATE CHANGE  DOESNT EXIST
1	just the fact that people are askingthe question
3	fish should stay in the ocean so they ca produce mor fish for our future
1	i think that bunnys should not ####

3	because wont be enough fish left
0	there is a chance of re pp®lation
0	This is a great option as it helps regulte hw much fish are biebg caugh and allow for the natural population tokeep withdemand. At the rate fish are caught and sold there nay be no fish left in the furtre to eat

0	because Iam going boling with my friends
0	i think its a great idea for todo that ithink it might be good for the  foods and p ets####
0	because it will leave more fish in the sea
0	because it will have more fish in the sea and ocean
0	only fish we need to eat should be caught.
0	becase fish and other species desearve tobe leftalone
0	we  believe that it is our responsibility to fish sustainably and stop other countries from over fishing the oceans.
1	so then you  are  not taking random fish outof the ocean which could make us sick .
4	it will inly force the price of fish up until we hit a point where its no longer viabld to buy. :(
0	this is an obvious solution to a probem people try to avoid. fish are running out lets do something about it.
0	because this is sucha massive issue and the rate at which we are over fishing our oceans is disgusting and we need someone to take a stand and make a change
0	the fish stocks need to be caredfor
0	i would love to have the knowledge and choice and would definitely paymore to support sustainable fishing
2	i am ## and don t buy food
0	because we will run out of fish one day ifwe continue to over fish the oceans
0	It ultimately contributes to a better future for the next generation which allows them to experience the full beauty of Aotearoa.
1	because I'm hopeful that it will encourse people to be more likely to buy sustsinable products.
1	that we need to take care of fih i our seas
3	im worried about the earths ocen being dirty
0	because we get better tasting fish
4	im angry because people is not looking for the rubbish bins and littering instead and killing animals ana killingthe sea animals and  animals
1	I  think we could do with more riubbish bins because people are littering every were.
0	i think this is a cool idea because then we will only be taking what we need instead of killing them and not using them
0	you should only take what you can eat
1	because i hope it will work and fish are important to the enviroment
1	So the next generation gets fish too
3	we need to look after our fish supplies
0	humans should not make anymore animals extinct.
0	i am going to the movies and i am having a play date
1	helps look after our rarer fish in the sea

0	to look after our oceans for future generations
0	Because   the sea will be safe
0	Because it is good for the sea
1	it would be very truthfull and understanding
1	for these fish to be a higher price because of them being caght and gotten eaten not nice for the  fish be nice.
1	i think we should use less plastic.
0	fish is a food that we dont need to eat so making itsustainable will help alooooooooot
0	i think that kids   should eat more noodles
1	it would be a step towards not poisening our environnmennt and makes climate change even more obvious. it also shows we care
1	i is a good surce of protien
1	The supermarket should do this bt it's a question of if they want to lose the profit

1	This will be a good thing for nz!  But how do we know that the companey that the fish is coming from is teling the truth?
1	sounds likea good idea and hopefullywill be better for us!:)
4	because fish is a good nz tradition
0	it would show the power of consumers
0	so less fish die a year
1	then there  would be more fish n the sea
1	So there are lot'more fish in the sea.
0	it will save more fish for the future meaning we will have fish for a long time
3	due to increased cost in all sectors .This will make it  another expense on top
3	because  peopel are throwing plastic and rubbish into the water
1	i think many people prepared to pay.
0	we want enough fish for ourselvves and future generations
0	because were destroying our sea's ecosystems and fish like the sun fish are going  to become extinct. so eating more hard to catch fish is better.
0	no commercial overfishing. catch your own if you love a particular species

0	bcauseweneedtoprotectourfutureand trytodo something agaibst theclimatechange. otherwisethe nextgeberations wobt beablteto live a life as kuxury abdgod ourss now. also the economic would fall down and there would be wars about living placement
1	i think its a good idea but it is to expensive for people to think about.
0	i think this would be a positive change for nz
1	i think that it poses positive change and a step towards further sustainable living
0	It will help people to relise the effort that is put into catching fish and notice the impact we as humans have on the fish numbers and wellfare
0	because there is more fish in the ocean
1	if we are aware. if its affordable and easy to purchase anything can work.
0	fish need to be cared for
1	it will get ride of pest and predators
0	i thinkthatthat is a great idea syke
2	this i avery good idea because the ocean is fullof wonderfulfish and the we should sustain our fish supply
1	because there will be fish forever

0	i think its good because then the fish that dont have many of their kind wont be caught to eat.
0	we need to keep our resources
2	becuse i dont eat fish also#doge life
0	we should look after our planet especially our water
1	this place is cool i guess  but the internet doesntwork
0	that we shouldonlyeat fish that are thriving

0	we should because a lot of fish are going extinct
1	we will have  more fish for the future generations
1	we can make sure that there are plenty of fish for our children and their children to eat
3	im worried because all the sea lfie could die incuding dohpins
1	im hopefull because it means that fish will repleanish them selfs and will keep our seas healthy
0	the marine ecology if in dire condition and must betreatedwith extreme care
0	becaue fishreis all over the world are collapsing tangata whenua suffer from depletion of thierkai moana by industrailand corpatefising vessels .also fishing netsa re the main source of plastic i the ocean. line caught is a better option for all
4	because there would be no more fish
0	so that we dont lose speciesof  fish
1	because it will be good for the enviroment
3	More carful of how they catch the different fish
0	we must do all we can to look after fish stocks
1	I think it is a good idea because its better for the environment and we need to help our planet
1	we need to protect our fisheries for the future
3	i dont want fish to go extenctic.
1	supermarkets should sell only  sustainably caught  fish because i dont want fish to go extinT
3	in case this makes seafood unavailable to disadvantaged people
1	ithink it is better fr the enviroment
3	supermarket's shouldent even be selling fish it belongs in the oceanARE YOU LISTENING!!?im talking to you fishmongers
1	because it is better for the enviroment and so we have mre fish.
0	so they catch there fish in a good way
0	we need to be kaitiaki. the true cost is to to factor in ecological cost...
0	how do we know are fish is sustainably  good and freash we should do better about protecting our enviroment
0	Because fish is delicous abd I love it
0	i am exited because i like exploring and discovering.
1	innovation takes time. chances are costs will reduce over time
0	this allows people to eat more fish and we wont need to worry about losing anyin the nearfuture
3	people dont even think about  where ourfood comes fom when it is in a plastic tray
0	I think this beacause I like to be sustainable.
0	other wise in commercial fishing lots of other fish get caught that shouldnt be caught and so they just throw them back in the ocean
0	supermarkets have huge power  if only they used it for all of our benefit
0	This will create a better enviroment for the fish and you would feel better when or if you eat it
0	it will be great because it will not upset the food chain and there will be more fish .
0	it will be good because we will not have more  fish to eat
1	its a good idea but we should not over fish
0	Because we are kaitakiand it is our responsibility. If we don't change our fish will become like our extinct birds
0	I think that it is a good idea because if we don't we might run out of some types of fish which would corrupt the food webs in the ocean.
0	we have a responsibility to protect our oceans and sealife
0	we have to become more conscious of our fish life and possibilityof extinction which would effect the whole ocean ecosystem.
0	N te mea he tangata tup®nuku ahau!!
1	we are not supposed to catch that many fish
0	we shouldn'do it any other way.
2	because i dont want to anwer
0	Because we care about the ocean and sea life
1	i think we should choose this option because if we use nets that could potentially harm dolphins and other sea life just so we can enjoy eating fish then it's not fair that other lives will have to suffer in the sea.
1	people are overfishing and this needs to stop
1	the fact that it is being recognized and discussed brings some hope  that the ecology of the oceans wontbe forced to collapse due to peoples laziness and greed
3	becuse i dont like fishbut anyway its a good idea
0	so we have fish  left to farm
0	ill know that we are living in balance with paptuanuku
0	we could use more variety of fish and process all of it.
1	we need to be better educated on where our food comes from... supermarkets and big companies should help by making smart choices too.
0	becuse we could helpsave the ecosystem
0	The oceans MUST be preserved. For humanity's sake and for the rest of the world. how shameful it is that we have killed and harmed the Earth so much. Future generations will either call us villains or respect that we made the changes nessesary to keep the planet alive.
0	because then there will be enough fish for a long time
0	I am very exitd about this and do beleve thatit mighthappen in the future.
1	people should put more thoughts into our environment and the species living on it. otherwise there wont be a bright FUTURE.
1	itwouldbe a much more realistic way to solve the issue because peoples social factors too often cloud their abilityto do whatis best  forthe greater wellbeing of the planet which i can relate to on mybest day never mind if iwas dealing with something pressing and overwhelming which we all do at times
0	The planet is NOT an infinite bounty of resources.
2	it will increase the cost ofliving. policing this at sea will be very hard and costly. the idea needs work.
1	Wouldbe great if thiskind of fish was available and clearly labelled
4	fish are part of nature to. we can't jjust kill them for no reason
1	i am hoping to get the fishstocks back. so we can have it for years to come.
1	Because it is better for Papa Tuanuku
1	i  think it is good for the invierment because people love to eat fish
1	i think our oceans have been stripped and thats somethung we just cant see or appreciate. our oceans need to be replenished
1	Im vegeterian why the frick do we not eat fish. What good doesit do to us that other food cant acomplish. If youareso sure abut eating fish say goodbyeto our oceans.
1	There should be stricter size size limitations so that young fish are thrown back so they can repopulate.
1	It would be great to see a supermarket just make this decision and begin. The easiest thing to do is just start.
1	because off thegrowing amount of plastic in the world supernarkets should be already be selling atleast compostabe bags
0	GREAT IDEA.  WE NEED TO LOOK AFTER OUR FISH STOCK.
0	cause then maybe dophins and other animals wont get caught and die forno reason
1	for fishing sourcesto stay sustained ad cared for
2	because it doesn't mater how much money you spend
0	because there will be more fish to eat and to help the enviroment
0	i love fish and there will be more if they are sustainable
0	i think that it would contribute to incresed fsh stock
0	sustainability will mean there are more of our favourite fish for the next generation... would love for my grandchildren to be able to taste snapper
4	we are  killing fish and our fish rate is gobg down we need fish for our life cyle
1	itsthestart ofbeig a cobservatoin focussed public
0	we need to keep breeding stocks for the future
1	It may only be one thing but we should have started to be more aware and proactive about our environment a long time ago. This is needed and overdue.
3	about  the  animals you are killing
1	IT WOULD BE BETTER FORALL OF THE WORLD AS EVERYONE CAN ENJOY THEM AND THERE WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE FUTURE.
0	so that we protect the fish in the future so that we never run out of fish
4	i hate nature andi think weshould kill it all and also chop our bums off when we run out of nature
1	over fishing now will mean no fish for the future
0	because it shows respnsible food gathering practices
1	I think people are becoming more aware of the impact we are having and are making decisions based on how we want our future to look.
1	it means people arethinkingabout where their food iscoming from
0	to maintin our fish stocks and so we don't take to much
1	ove fish so i want it for dinner and it is good for u so b bye
4	becase i lovefishas my secand fav animal
4	becuse u are kiling fish and u r a###
4	becase fish are my secand fav animal
0	everyobe should do their part to  care for the environment
0	we should care more about how our seafood lived and its future generations
1	because you should'nt what you waste  what you have
0	sustainable fishing means protecting diadromous fish as well as marine.
1	an aspirational target that kiwis should work towards
2	because I Dont  Know What It Means
0	so there is fish for the future
1	marine life is an essential part of the ecosystem and any potential threat to this may compromise the whole system and we all loose.
1	It would be an amazing step in the right direction for New Zealand if all supermarkets sold sustainably caught fish. Keeping our oceans wildlife and ecosystem healthy should be a top priority here in NZ. Unsuastainable fishing does the opposite of this!
0	it should not be farmed as it is fish full of hormones that are dangerous to our health and wellbeing.
0	then our world will be more saved
0	to save sea mammals and make sure the next generations can eat fish too
0	because we should already be selling sustainaby caught fish and at least this will conform that
0	im excited because it will be saving the endangered fish and its good for our planit
0	we want fish stocks to last
0	it would promote safer fishingmethods and try to help make sustainable methods of fishing to protect our marine life
1	because we have 20 years before climate genocide. we need to change our habits
1	It is never too late to make a change.. but we need to make it now!
0	because otherwise we will run out of resources
1	its positve that these things are being discussed
1	i am worried about the fish.
1	plenty of other  things to eat. once theyre gone they wont come back
1	commercial catch size limits should increase cost should stay the same
0	fish should derserve better care like the birds.How would it feel if they suddenly started selling kiwi?
1	because we need to makedrastic change tosave theplanet now
0	its the rightthng to do we need to respect and care for the land
3	let the fish live. Humans don't need to eat fish or meat!
0	less impact on thewaters   surrounding the contry
1	this is great and people willmostly agree
0	that we need to be more aware of what we consume and consume ethically in order to be sustainable and provide a promising future
1	if more people care about this it will become the normal way of doing things.and we wont even need to ask this queston anymore
2	i  don't care as long asny fish isyummy
2	i dont really give two ##### as log as m fush and chups
2	i dont really care as longs my fish is gud
1	shouldnt need to cost more. quotas are not given correctly but media can portray things much diffrently to how it is. illegal fishing opperations must have bigger sentances.
0	good for the environmnt so its  worth it
1	otherwise there wont be any left
1	important for sustainabilty however some people already cant afford food
0	better to pay more now than to not have any tomorrow
1	im hopeful because its a brighter future for thefish and our oceans
1	I hope that the fish can be happy like the people
1	because you can eat smiley fish and take a fat happy ####
1	because in the fish there are anthibiotic and its bad for huan
1	That if we hunt all the fish ther will be none left for other sea life and birds.
0	we need to stop using money as the only way we measure value
1	its the only way to maintain supplies
1	I dont realy eat fish but  it is annoying that people are allowed to fish unsustainably.
1	sounds like a good idea. there are plenty of other options so i support an approach that encourages sustainability
3	will not be any  fish left in the sea
1	our oceans are more important than cheap fish n chips!
3	Our corporations should be behaving sustainably
1	it would be good for the animals that are ebdabgered
3	because the fish will just taste the same
4	they should only sell sustainably caught fish dammit
1	i think supermarkets need better controls to be more sustainable and cost should not be a reflection to increase profit.
1	One can only hope that sustainibility is put before greed
1	ur values are changing. slowly but surely
1	blockchain tech is being used to make seafood traceable right down the supply chain. In the future we should be able to scan our food to understand it's journey to the supermarket.
1	I WORRY THAT EATING FISH WILL DEPEND ON YOUR FINANCIAL CAPACITY
1	its in our control so why not...!?!
1	because its beter for the world
0	because people can eat fish but the fish stay healthy
0	it would be good for the sea the fish and the people
1	Our finite resources should be lk?d after or they'll run out.
0	because  if we cach the fish that are endangered there will be none left.
1	soon there will be n fish in our oceans
1	move towards sustainability. needto protect our oceans
1	I think that fish should be protected and sould be sold at a medium price because people need to survive with food and fish but on the other hand we still need to eat fish.
1	because it helps us do the right thing.
3	no more fish left if we  catch them all and eat them
1	its a good idea because a lot of fish are goingextinct and we need to take  better care of them
1	we need tolive wthin the limits of what Pllanet Earth can sustain .
0	To save the other fish species
1	Because it's a sustainable practice that we should be doing anyway!
0	it is the right thing todo
0	it will make a bi difference
0	sooner we change the cheaper in the long run
1	it shouldnt cost more. we should not export as much.
1	sustainability is a way to mitigate over population and excessive consumption
0	i will be happy to pay a little bit more just to make sure next generations will also enjoy natural products
1	it would be great but i do not think its possable
1	it would be better for the fish
0	We don't have the right to run our resources out just because we want to have more of something or to pay less.
0	i think the government needsz to make fisheries be m open about where thir fish are caught.
1	we need the fsh to still exist in good numbers well into the future. Fishing iznanirresposible names sees fish stock disappearing.
0	current quota management hasbeen developed without true sustainability in mind. drive for sustainability from major buyers is the only thing that will change that meaning a healthier marine ecosystem.
1	I feel hopeful because it is a step towards a future where people wont it fish at all. All it does is make problems for us. Not only economically and sustainably but also morally.
1	because they have more chance of survival
0	we want to keep the fish alive for the fuure
0	Ensuring our resources are sustainable is a key factor to preserving these for use and enjoyment for future generations
1	its good for nz to improve our sustainibility #skux
0	i like fish to live long happy lives
0	we should try to catch everything with buckets
4	I really like fish. I want cheap fish!!!!!
1	the current  threats to our wildlifepopulations created by people need to be taken seriously. and we need to accept that respnsibility even if it costs us mr money
0	we are all accountable. currently thee is no transparency.
0	our ecosystem is worth protection. even if it hurts our economy.
2	i dont care becase i just do not care so there!
2	Because i dont like fish .
0	This way provides opportunity for sea life to thrive enough to catch.
1	i m hopeful because the fish might be better value.
1	That is a good idea but that would bebad for the poor
1	We need to protect fih stocks for the future
1	overfishing is a big problem nobody seems to be aware of.
2	does it really matter as long as we eat it
1	i think its a good idea i just hope people dont take it upon thenselves to catch their own fish illegally
1	It is a first step to a new market model
4	we shouldnt be catching ANY fish... LEAVE THEM IN THE OCEANS and eat fully sstuainable plant based diets
0	we need to preserve resources we have if we want to recover our ecosystems. We should also stop illegal imports and exports as this also has dire effects on ecosystym sustanibility.
0	If we like eating fish we might enjoy still getting to eat it in the future rather than just remembering how it tasted.
1	governent should grow some balls and stop big companies from raping our oceans. i am forever hopeful but it will be too late by the time they sort somethng out.
1	it would mean we ar thinking sustainably
1	The fishing industry is like soooo probematic
1	Seeing supermarkets take a stronger stance on environmental issues to which they directly contribute such as sustainable foodstuffs and soft plasics is a necessary step towards a sustainable future. The sale of seafood caught through ecologically destructive means makes the entire industry complicit in the destruction of this planet.
1	BECAUSE ALSO THE sea is a wildlife area and need more than ever our protectiob
0	it is better for the  enviroment. the planet we live on is the only one we have and we are slowly destroying it. we have to unite to save the flora and fana of this world
1	A stepib the right direction fora better tomorrow.
0	sustainably caught fish means that fish breeds wont die out
1	we need to portect are fish beacuse soon there will be no fish
1	one hook one fish   ban nets
0	because then the fish species will not die out
1	i hope   suermarkets will see  how important it is to save our fish or whats left of it
0	we have made the planet and its creatures suffer enough. It is time to take responsibility. Today we can decide what we want to safe: some money or our future
0	we have to make the difference now
0	to help the environment which is more important than any money
0	because it is essential towards  protecting marine life into the future.
1	it would be great if all aspects of consumption became mindful...it would be even better if we reconsidered whether we even NEED to eat fish. Realistically most of us can live without eating any animals.
0	i like it because it has cahnge and its  the best place to come to
3	in the future fish are no longer going to be alive
2	Because it is ###### extra cost for something we can get for ######
1	The only way for our oceans to recover is to clean them of plastic and let fish populations replenish
1	i am hopeful that we can sustain at risk species
1	because businesses havea responsibility to support consumers.  businesses need to be as conscious of their decisions on our environment and future as muchas making money its not just the financial bottom line but a ecological survival bottom line.
1	because we should be lookibgafter our planet by more ways than sustaining and recyclig
3	we dont nkow if its unstainably yet
4	i think this because this is not right selling fish its like selling people in a frezer
1	because the fish will last longer that way
1	it will have to be carefully moniterd
0	If we continue to fish the way we are there will be no fish left in our oceans. Eveb better would be no fish at all!
0	what is the true costof over fishing our oceans?and who bares it? answer ...future generations and food system break down .
0	We should protect our fish popuations. They are important to the oceans eco systems.
1	All things we take from our aready suffering planet should be taken with the certainty that what has been taken will replenish itself in time. If we can't garuntee that our resources will thrive then shouldn't be taking them. Only selling sustainably sourced fish gives me hope for the future of our Earth and its ecosystems.
1	There are always two sides to think about. Yes we need to look after our fish stocks but peope also rely on commercial fishing for employment. Careful balance is the only answer.
3	not everyone can pay so there will always be both sustainably and other
0	conservation is extremely important andshould be  priority esp with nzs fishingculture
1	sign we are moving towards a more sustainable future
0	its good for the planet ecosystem
0	by doing this we could protect our fishstocks and protect those in trouble
0	we should  stop using plastic because it gets in our oceans
0	farmed fish are unhealthy food as they themselves are not nourished and unable to grow naturally and in a healthy manner and environment.
1	because it would be better coulity andhelp the planet
0	because it could possibly work and if it did i forgot the question buti think it would be good maybe!!!
1	im hopeful because weve had enough fish. caleb age 6
0	Because our children also want to eat fish and millions of people are independent of that natural source.
0	sustainability shuld be at the forefront of all industries
0	we need to think long term to be here long term
1	Almost all Kiwis care about our environment and that includes fishermen and fishing companies (except Talleys). As consumers we have to support the people and companies doing the right thing. Fish has to considered a treat and a luxury and we should value it.
0	I think as people we should be promoting any kind of eco-friendly farming to help sustain a unique culture
1	itis  inprtant to consider our impact  on the earth for futuregenerationns we have been too slack about the future
1	this should be a way of life from now and makes eating fish less accesible
0	because in the end you cant breathe eat or drink money
0	It is important to keep the eco system in balance.
1	supermarkets are begining to realise that people are concerned about whereproduce comes from and how sustainable its production is.
1	sustainabilty is key to our future.!!!!
0	because i would rather consume a sustainably caught food
1	bcuz we wanna have fish duh
0	is good. less extinct fish. maybe? c:
3	Go vegan. if you really love animals you wouldnt be eating them.....
0	the enviromentis is danger for thousends of species and the next genaration. shouldn't life be put above money
3	because profit for the few will always outweigh the needs of humanity  ..
1	we willbe  able to eat fish for longer if we chose nore sustainabe ways the alternitive is to let themd issapear for good
1	i dont know. it just seems like if we catch less it would be better for our seas
0	it will hell keep our fish around for longer
0	then there will be fish for the future
1	this change will help the enviorment but not as many people will be able to  afford it.
0	because its the only sensible optionand we willfarm them properly hopefully
1	Because it will mean that we are respecting the sea floor and not catching unwanted sea creatures which are weakened and thrown back.
3	there are a lot of people that cant afford more expensive fish
0	we need sustainable fish for our health and water is precious.we depend on our oceans so very much and fish life is vital to that.

0	need to look after our moana
3	i think its never  going to happen
1	Its only the first step to saving the environment. Theres still so much to be done.
1	The land and the oceans do not belong to us. We belong to them - and we need to protect and preserve them just as they protect and preserve us.
0	because we have to care about the ocean
0	because we need a change in our waywe treat the envirnment
0	i think it would be very good because sometimes supermarket products are ba for the environment
3	many fisheries are over fishing their quotasbut are not being caught .plus another concern is the huge amount of plastics in our oceans . they wash up on our beach all the time which is only a tiny part of it
1	hopefully we can help save the ocean populations
0	fish are friends - not food
0	good start hoever people shouldn't be eating fish at all - fishing equipment makes up almost half of the plastic in the ocean. No one should be fishing - its killing the planet.
1	Because if the seafood is sustainable then the ecosystem will be balenced enough to survive as long as people don't take too much fish.
1	because if the seafood is poluted we won't be abel to eat it

0	hi like fortnite battle royale i am skipping school to watch fortnitepro and and i have to leak the season 10 them because my mum works for epic games i am going to new york just to watchminecraftand fortnite goodbye
0	if it will preserve our fisheries then its a great thing. prices are pretty high so adding on a bit more is not going to make that much difference to the pocket
0	Commercial fishing is having a serious impact on the number of fish/species and has caused many to decline to worryingly low numbers. Sustainable fishing prevents over-exploitation and by-catch and protects the environment
1	local grocery could be affected. national chains should adapt
1	It makes shopping muc more deliberate if you have to carry it
0	if we dont fish population will drop
0	because the world needs to make a change and developed and rather rich countries like NZ should take the lead or at least set a good example. And the sustainibly fished fish tastes better anyway
1	it could save our future and the future of the ocean most imortantly. lots of fish like we know them are very endangered; think about tuna and salmon. however what would really solve the problem is just to stop eating fish overall.
1	hopeful  is way better than don't care

0	We will value what we buy orcatch ourselves much more.
1	our ocean's health is of the utmost importance
1	now people are more aware of what it is doing
0	dont wnt to eat plastic in my fish
1	if we don't learn to live our lives sustainably our planet has no future
1	I think humans should buy this more expensive type of fish because i think in long term benefits it would only get cheaper. I think it would get cheaper because if you eat the cheaper (more unhealthy) type thereis a higher chance of getting sickor ill. In cheaper fish there is a higher chanc of you ending up eating plastic. in the long term you may end up paying medical bills.
0	it is important to look after the earthabd ocean
0	it is important because the loss of one species due to   unsustainable fishing could result in the loss of many more causing issues in our global food sources to continue to gt worse
0	Preserving the planet and its life is more important than cost
1	What good argument is there for fishing anything that is not demonstrably sustainable?
0	to sustain stocks by reducing cut pricing
0	if its not sustainable  catch then theres no future catch
0	i think we are parasites. Humans need to give more than we receive. Also. fish rule.
0	It's time to stop choosing convenience over what is sustainable and supportsthe well being and flourishing of more species than just our own. We need to recognize the well being of them is the same as the well being of us. theyre not seperate entities.
1	for the future of the ocean
0	this would be good as pepole could finally   get fish that  would last longer and would help the eco system
1	we ae looking o make change
1	We will be able to conserve andrepopulate overfished and struggling    species
0	other animals such as dolphins ect perish in unsustainable fishing environments
4	we need more potatoes and more barbushka
1	because we have to be prepared to value what is important
0	because overfishing derregulates our ecosystem and reduces thechance of small fishermen and women to su  stain themselves.
1	it would make a big difference
1	we need to think about the future
1	i think hat its a sustanoble way to keep our planet alive
3	worried that we're not doing enough to help marine life or save our planet
4	fish should never be killed in the firstplace
4	i do feel that the fishing industry is causing a lot of harm to the environment. Natural sources are being depleted and we are completely disregarding the fact that we are disturbing and destroying their habitat. Eat sustainably.
1	This is so important and essential! If people want to keep eating fish in the future they are crazy to not implement this!
0	we do not have the right to fish in such a huge manner like we do right now. Let the sea life recover!
0	...we should save the marine life all over the world! no! We have too! fish& chips isn't worth a collapse of marine life!!!
2	becuse i am allergic to seafood
0	because we need tofix our oceans so sealife can recover
0	you should ever only take what you need for anything so to sell our kaimoana they should most definatley take what ika are sustaining in this day and age
0	humans are part of the environment
0	protect the oceans and the life within
0	because it will is more important to protect the environment than have a cheaper fish for dinner
1	It's the right thing to do. For everybody.
1	it would mean that we are all united in the fight against species extition and climatic  changes
1	we must act now to create a sustainable economy
1	### rights. also i love #### #######
0	we need to take responsibilty for the futre supply of fish
1	as long as there are uncontrolled black markets I fear it will not fly
1	cuss you dont now whats gonna happen so you cant be excited
0	if we are not sutaiable then future generations will not enjoy what our generation have
0	it will help reduce the chance of more fish becoming extinct
0	only way to preserve fish as food
0	we need to  conserve our ever decreasing rescourses
0	because they want to get nz pestfree
4	i think i should eat  #### insted
0	hmmmmmmm ah thats it  dont no
3	I am worri becaue fish night die
1	i really hope that they will
0	i think we should cut of fish ing in places that native fish thrive to in crease the population of fish
0	if we over fish - the fish will run out
1	if we dont fish sustainably and we over fish etcthen there will e no more fish in the oceans as we woudhave killed and eaten them all and this willhave terrible effectson our oceans ecosystems and the environment
1	i feel hopeful because it would bring more life to the world
1	hopeful because it can help the world for supermarkets
4	because it woundnt help the world
0	finally we mightsrart to make a difference...before its too late
0	i think that is the rightdirection for the world
2	cause i dont know what it means
0	that  we should eat clean fish
1	i would lke to eat clean steak
1	ilike fish. i like eating sustainably caught fish. iam happyto pay a little more.
0	we know that it will help the enviroment
1	Because we want to still have fish in our seas.
0	drag fishing is a major  threat to the enviroment not doing it will save the oceans nd the dolphins
0	drag fshing is a major threat to the enviroment stoping will save the oceans and dolphins
0	Im exited because  if you find something in the big nets that you do not want you throw it out and you have killed it for no reason . It is just waste
1	this would be good because there will be more fish in the seaand they will stop dying
1	i thik it would be greatbecause we dont want any more fish ging extinct.s my bdayis soon . ps I LOVE ######
1	sep peeps ps I LOVE BEARS
3	the people could all be lying about them being caught propely and nicely
1	i think it would be really good for  the ocean.
0	i think it will be good 4 the environment
0	we should care more about te ocean
0	i dont eat fish and theway people fish todayis a big reason for  it
0	sustainable fishing fits us as humans better. makes us more humane
0	because it is the only way we will have access to this reasource in the future
0	sustanability has to be rhe way of the future and supermarkets are going to be contributors to that becoming reality
1	cause fresh fish is the best
1	This gives me hope that we can recover thr fish populations
1	bc theb we can eat abd srvive longer
0	we need this to be a reality if  our grandchildren are ever to eat fresh wild fish
0	because its the ethical wayforward. once its gone its gone
1	because eating fish hopefully leads to less meat consumtion
1	hard to break free from oil addiction
0	Having sustainably caught fish should matter more than money especially in the epidemic we are experiencing today.
1	This way we can ensure future generations have fish to enjoy as well.But what are the job implications?
1	unsustainable fishing is destroying our oceans
1	If ya like fish so much - ya gotta treat 'em right
1	its a balance between economy and ecology. hopefully ecology wins
0	because we need to stay surstainable!!!!!!!!!!!
1	It can have a positive impact on both the environment and the species itself. We should also diversify the fish market to reduce our impact on the same two fish populations.
0	ya boy shouldlook after the enviroment
1	i THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE IT NAY UP THE PRICES BUT IT WILL BE FISH IN BETTER CONDITION?
0	i it cool inthe earth q house
0	i think it is good because it means notso many fish are being killed
0	it was a awesome eq house but i liked the old one moreit was more shaky
1	that if we are killing any fish we wont have any left
0	because i want t save the fish.
0	i can know more about tsunami. abouttherocki learned in EARTH SPACE SCIENCE
0	its better fr us and the enviroment
0	the seas are dying. everybody should do theirpart
1	its a great start towards a moresustainable future
0	sustaiable procurement of meat icluding fish is the need of the hour.  we are threatening our biodiversity by indiscriminately hunting our animals
1	small step in the right direction but probably still not enough
0	to cut down on people eating it
0	the secies are more important to our earth then to our plate
0	protect fish that are threatened by overfishing
0	becausethe enviroment deserves to be looked after
0	this is a greatidea and if it was sustainaby packaged too i would buy it
0	i think this is a great idea. it is sustainable and it is based on the same principle as farming cows for example. let the fishes be free
1	Greed will always prevent this happening
0	good idea. anybody who likes eating fish should agree.
1	I think that this is a wonderful idea that should definitely be  brought in if we want the future generations to have any fish at all.
0	its something that needs to happen in order to ptorect ouroceans
0	We are a wealthy and innovative nation. we have the resourse to do better for our enviroment
0	i think sierra likes this place
0	we should all be more responsible inour food choices. the way we are consuming is killing our planet
3	poor people wont be able to afford that option.
0	Because it is the right thng to do
3	we need this world but it doesnt need us
1	cause food sud be sustaniable foourdieibg future
2	hei painga mo papatuaanuku. mo nga uriwhakatipu.
0	I want a fishery my kids can enjoy too
1	its the right thing to do
3	What if i  run out of money and cant eat fish
0	because i said that it is the right  idea
1	once they are gone they are gone
0	because we need to replenish our oceans to save our planet and people
1	we need to take actions thatindividuals can do and support easily
1	it would be great but might cause problems for people without enough money to buy more expensive fish
0	better for he survival of the world
1	The way the fishng industry is now is unsustainable and will destroy any remaining sealife we have if it continues.
0	only farmed fish shouldbe sold in supermarkets
2	because its good for the enviroment
0	That Fisheries need to lok at the whole ecosystem not just species by species
1	This is a great idea because it helps the fish population and the environment.

0	its important to support ethical and environmentally sustainable options if we want a healthy home
0	So that we don't run out!!
1	because we need to make some significnt changes to the way we consume food to ensure we dont lose any more spieces and there will be enough resources for future generations
1	we need to start paying the real price of food factoring in environmental as well as economic costs
0	A sustainable future is more important than short term profits.
0	that this is an excellent idea
1	Supermarkets are a powerful intermediary in the food suply chain. Their policies affect suppliers and nudge consumers.
2	cause i was not born in the 90s r 80  s
3	living expenses are already high if you restrict the options it will become unaffordable for the general population
0	we need to preserve our ocean life
1	Only way to sustain but howdowe make surelowerincome families can still get the goodness ib their diets?
0	it will benefit the sustainibility of the fish and preserve the species
0	supply vs demand. stop overfishing and ruining the ocean beds.
0	so that we dont overfish them by accident lol
0	we have a responsibiitytoall species on earth
0	because  fish have a right to live as well
0	because we need to keep fish in our oceans
1	we have to think of the longterm
4	is were someone could fell down or even visious to kick some ones ass
1	becuse we willrun out of resources soon
1	we human need to be more responsible for the planet. change is coming but needs to be faste
1	i like nz caught fresh fish but limit the catch and also eat the by catch. nothing should be put back dead.olny catch what we can eat.
0	as everyone will pay the price ifthey became extinct how sad would that be. we need to all be conscious and made to be accountable
0	we dont want to find nemo
0	Fish are over farmed. Its not sustainable to continue fishing like we are.
1	more fsh means healthier oceans and ecsystem staying in balance
0	i think that we need to protect the species we have we cant afford to destroy our planet for greedyness
0	WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR OCEANS
4	that it is unfairthat supermarkets do this
0	beacause then we will havemore fish duh
1	i hope people will do this and not be greedy and short sighted.
1	i dont eat fish so idc
0	supporting sustainable means should be a prioirty. if you cant afford to pay for it dot buy it
4	we should stop fishing. fish nets are the main source of plastic in the ocean. we are killing whole ecosystems by fishing which are necessary to sustain life on earth.
1	How does one really know if the  fish are sustainability caught?
2	go vegan and it wont matter
0	just morally correct for us and the wildlife
3	be cause i dont wont them to get extinct
1	i have to believeit is not too late
1	because plas bever work out with people
1	we need to be the generation that acts and stops observing.  im hopefull we can as the consequences if we dont are massive.
1	i think its a  good idea
1	only sustainable fishing  should be acceptable to keep our waters ecology sound.
1	maybe supermarkets might takeatheir responsibility seriously
0	we want to ensure that our children have a wonderful natural environmment to protect and enjoy.
0	too many fish are dying. also a lot of the plastic in the ocean are from fishing tools.
3	i think that the plethra of
4	fsh are kinda gay sod em
3	I think there is still atoo high demand of fish and people dont  care if its sustainable they just care about the price
0	be great to only have sustainable fish in our supply chains.  NZ should be world leaders  in this
1	with educating people we will make our people realise how importantit is
1	that this might be a way of applying sustainable practice in a way tha the economy does notsuffer toomuch
1	poverty is high. good protien is getting too expensive already
2	i dont eat it from a supermarket

3	I think itll be even more expensive
0	i think it will help conserve fish diversity
0	enImagine if every fish we eat we ate knowing  that we have a positive influence on our environment. Even if it costs more. Money is not important: at the end of the day it's just a collection of steel and paper to make us feel important. But knowing that you have protected the environment that matters.
1	i  think that that is fair to the fish i just hope that they take only the fully growen and not the babies
1	maybe our children will be able to eat plastic free ish fish
1	i think its unfair that we talk about saving the fish but never put in the effort. lasticis bad enough let alone eat the fish. WE ARE ALREADY SLOWLY KILLING THEM
1	overfishing is drain on national resources and indigeonous quantity rights
0	sustinable food sources are importntfor or future
1	it is important to keep most wild life
1	the responsibility of the current generation
0	long term our childrens children will benefit
3	what will happen in 10 years from noe? will very species in the wter dispear??
1	because i want this to happen but it does not seem likely at the moment
0	because  it will sustain us the same and its mor enviromentaly friendly
1	should happen but politics  . needs to happen before iits too late
0	politics should care more because overfishing makes nz fish extinct.
0	because it will sustain us in the same way however it will have less enviromental impact however I still want the sales people have profatable sales
1	i feel hopful because it doesnt kill other animals
0	yes they should because in first place it is good for the enviroment and also it prevents a lot of possible diseases
0	Because people who overfish will not anymore and sharks seals and other fish eating animals will live.
0	fishing is currently not regulated enough and is decimating the oceans ecosystem.
0	tht sounds like a great idea
1	fish is a wonderful thing to treasure... lets make them last
1	it means we are having the conversationaboutspecies conservation
0	thatit will be better for the ecosystem but won't really have that good of a range.
0	because there will be fish for sale in future
1	fish is not an everlasting food
3	we  dont want them to sell fish that are not sustainable caught.
1	It  makes sense to look after our waters and creatures .
0	because why not enjoy life because you have a purpose
0	no other way doing it in the long run
0	because fish is good for you
0	i want to save all animls
0	because it means better  sustainability in our oceans
0	its imortant to have sustainable fisheries
1	Being able to eat sustainable food sources is important for retaining parts of our culture for the future.
4	i think this place is the best
1	this is a great idea as it will help to make sure there are plenty of fish to eat in the future.
1	i love te papa because it helps me lirn
0	the best day of  my life
2	my name is #### iam clinicly
1	i dont know but i think this the right awnser
0	They defitnely should. 74 percebt of fish are extibct
1	becoming  more like a farm and less of taking without limitation is a better  way to get what we need without inflicting damage to populations of  fish.
1	We need to protectt our sea life. we only get one ocean and want tomake it susatinable for the next generatons. i dont thinkpeople really understand how important this is .
1	it is the right way to go and it shows that supermarkets are recognising th problem
2	because i like fishies and they play with me
0	IT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT IDEA!!!
1	I LOVE THE IDEA. IT IS GREAT!!
1	it would help to protect our oceans for the future but i find it hard to believe big corporations would get on board with this
4	potatos are rare in the fish eyes. think about life its like a flamingo.
0	it was very intresting because  earthquake house and the squid
1	that there is all ofthestuff that washere the last time i came here
0	because if they sell fresh fish it might jump into the trolley and we will have a free fish
1	It's ultimately up to the consumer to invite such a sustainable culture. If we did it would definatly help
0	we should be looking after our kai moana more
1	however much it costs they should use sustainbly caught fish
0	to protect the oceans of overfishing and to keep the balance of animals livng in the oceans
2	bc ######### and ###### ##### don.t care
0	I think we should care more about our oceans. Just because we dot see the damage to our marine life everyday doesnt mean its not happening.
4	How has it taken so long to consider change? Sustainability is a must. The environment is worth paying more for!
0	sustainability is the only way forward
1	people will adapt to change but only if they dont have much option. Oth################## will always buy whats cheaper
1	poor people should be able to eatfish too. so subsidise?
1	corporations should be held accountable for their environmental impact
0	human history has demonstrared thatwe consistently underestimate our impact and overestimate our ability to solve problems. we need to embracea minimimum impact lifestyle if we want to continue to exist
0	because then the fish supply will not run out and the endangered species will not become extinct. it will also contribute to pollution and destoying the beautiful environment.
0	protect the ocean - we arent living sustainably :(
1	sounds like a relatively easy change that will have a massively positive impact
1	because it shows we are thinking about sustainable future
2	because that will give us more fish
4	cause we have to pay more money and thats waste
0	we need to do everything we can to lessen Our carbon footprints
1	such a vast arrat of our owb species of fresh fish no need to omport from elsewhee
0	this isa good idea because there would  less plastic
1	I am the cleverest one in the world2333333
0	if we continue to overfish we could risk not even having them. expensive fish are better than no fish.
0	Fish are awesome and should be treated as such my dude
0	need to leave the fish  alone
1	without increasing the sustainability of our consumption we are all negativly impacting our natura lresouces
0	that ur shopping habits can help fisheries
0	If we care about the future and preserving the beauty of NZ we need to act
0	we should protect our worldwith everything in it
1	thatwe will stillhave fish into the future
1	Awareness of our enviromental issues are great but we should supporting the cause too. this would be a huge step forward plus over fishing is definitly a prblem
0	because i havent bean here in for ever
1	because it hurting sea life and for people who dont have money
0	i sell fish and will make more money for strippers
2	i don't cr? b®t th? wrld
1	It would be a greatway to reduce dying fish life. it could be a bit of a problem to convince some people who's income depends on overfishing.
0	i think that we need to bring this in as fast as possible before it is to late.
2	cause FISH IS YUM any day or any way.
0	cause it will make the fish happy
4	WHY ARE WE EATING FISH IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU@##$$#_#@@#
3	I dont know all ups and downs
0	Because if we catch fish more sustainably then we will be making a change in how much we are polluting.
0	because i have never been to te papa before and everything that is here is really cool.And i love te papa now
4	because iam not a fan people
2	becuse i dont care and i with my baby yeaaaa nd ur looking at me like nobody lyric song by ##### ###### and ## ######

0	The earth will only survive ifwe are thinkibg sustainably. we need to prioritize practises that benefit the earth and not always be thinking about profits or the cost. cheaper doesnt always mean better.
1	I feel hopeful because it will be better for every one.
0	i think is is ok tobe cxcited
2	i dont care about the earth. you ar dum
0	I feel HAPPY because I was exited for the earthquake house.
2	i do care about the erth so we canchang that
1	It will be better for every one.
1	Its a great step toward protecting our ocean life and making sure there is fish for our future kiwis
1	becase it has a good intension
3	not everyone would like to pay much more money on it
0	Because our consumerism destroys nature wildlife life and eventually ourselves. Taking care of the life and products we use eat drink and consume will change our perspective on life  and so on.
1	we shouldnt be stocking fish if it isnt sustainble because that means we are supporting theissue
0	because oterwise therewill be no fish at all....
0	we need to start using resources in a more sustainable manner to ensure a future of abndance for generations to come
0	It will keep the ecosytem as healthy as currently possible
1	i dont even like fish :p
1	I don't eat fish but the world use to have balance but throughout the industrial era the balance was broken
1	i dont even eat fish :p
0	we take moresea food then we need to people need to learn to stop being greedy
2	I never liked this fish stuff
0	because we need to keep sustainable levels of ealife in our oceans
1	i  think that we need tohnor every life that feeds us
0	we need to start caring about the world
1	so our fishing stocks don't get depleted
0	To be honest ® dont buy fish. So I would be happy to leave more in the ocean.
0	cos its important for my child to have the experience of fish when shes older
0	we should noteat fish at al but moving to eating only sustainablly caught fish whatever that is is a movein the right direction
0	it is the responsible way to be
0	we must think of the planet and care for the animals plnts and people
1	temporary pain long term gain... doesnt  just refer to sports but also our wallets
3	Plant based would be better for the majority of the population.reduce demand of fish meat and dairy. increase demand of plantbased.
0	i would like to be able to eat fish for a long time
0	i think this should be readynow
0	its a betterstep. but being vegan is the bestoption
1	i mean its no going veganbut its a start
1	Sustainability is more important than money. Ideally we could stop eating then altogether.
0	god iz fis bcause fis ar nice

0	i think ##### is very beautiful
0	it is important to protect ecosystems
3	The oceans feed the ecology of the planet
0	one planet one eco system. we should act well we can
3	i think that this is a great idea but that supermarkets   wont do it
0	we need to lead the way
1	we need the produce  of the sea for many generations to come
0	we need to look long term.
0	i think this is the only wa to mae fishing sustainable
0	we should fish for fture generations
1	if you can only buy a sustainable product supply will naturally increase
1	that it is good for supermarkets to produce sustainable fish as then less as then the fish will stay as an unendangered species or if endangered recover more easily
0	its the right thing to do.  LOook after the ocean.
0	we r gonna die from it anyways
1	there would be a chance fish stocks can be maintained at healthy levels
0	it gives us hope that there will be a future of fishing for my children and grandchildren
1	fornow we should only eat sustainably caught fish so other fish will not go instinct.
0	gives the ocean a chance to replenish
4	maniac people who catch sharks are weirdos
0	the time for change is now before its too late
1	It is an exciting idea that would serve NZ well but I can only hope that it is a plan we would stick to. Less talk and more action.
1	fish are cooland we want to keep them
0	excited is like being SUPER happy for something to hapen
4	angry is when your are not happy with someone or something
0	so we have a future in which everything thrive
0	It is probably better for the enviroment overall unlike electric cars.
1	because we should but people might not
1	we need to look after our planet better
0	we need to preserve our fish stocks
1	cause it will safe our planet
3	because people might judge the fish even kids will
0	sustainable for our future generations. also allfish should becaught via rod and reel onlly
0	its not about the money.ts beig able to teach our future generations about providing fortheir fsmilies within limits.. fish for a feed not for the freezer
0	Sustainability is about looking after the ecosystem ad the future kaimoana for generations to come - Toit® te marae a Tane-Mahuta; Toit® te marae a Tangaroa; Toit® te tangata - if the land is well and the sea is well; the people will thrive
0	it would be enviromental and they wuld
0	people shouldtake neasures for sustanable envirnments even if it adds sone cost. we should fibd creatve ways to offset these costs abd help each oter in the monuental task ofpreservibg theplaet for future generations.
1	it would be enviromentaly friendly and kill a LOT less innocent fish
1	I think that it will be better for the eviroment
1	better for the environment and a moresustaiable future
1	i feel we need to protect the ocean. it is not happening now and we have a real likelyhood of ruining the eco system carrying on like we are. stop the greed that causes this
3	i think that ths is a good ideabecuase it may help the env®rn?nt
1	Our oceans are precious and our wildlife deserve better.
0	if it's sustainable it provides for future generations
0	we dont want to have anymore species extinct.
0	because I really like the environment and I don't want it to get hurt
2	there isno form of fishing that is sustainable. the future is patbased
1	Maybe they should not sell fish at all we can all bcom hppy vegeitarians!!
0	then there will always be fish for my kids and my grandkids to eat
0	because its better for us  and them we get fish more often and they survive
0	i am happy  because i can share fish with my whanau
1	i hope  they only sell sustainable caught fish to avoid depletion of our fish and food for other fish
1	that would be kool  but the  ecconmy could crash in the long run  type stuff you know
0	Current fishing practices are destructive to fish stocks and the surrounding environment and other species
0	no fish is less important than a supermarket profit margin
2	i don't care because i love salmon witch is a typeof fush and it yummy...
0	overishing is an issue. There soon mightbe almost no fish in the sea if we are not sustainable with it
1	because i think its cruel to kill fish alive thats why im vegatrian
1	they need to put the environment before profit for a change.
0	people dont appreciate that most of the safood industry isntsustainable
0	ITS ABOUT TIME ANIMALS GET RESPECTED
0	sustainability is more important than accessibility
0	I dont want the fish to go extinct.
0	to maintain healthy and working food chains. not just humans depend on this food source
1	I don't want to eat microplastics.
0	save fish population as well as other marine animals that may have these as a foo source
1	i think this cause fish is yum
1	I am hopeful that the probem willget better if we do somehing.
1	more sustanablity means future resources survive
1	because we are thinking about our future and the environment for the better
0	better for the enviroment over all
1	it will be good for the peeps
3	shouldnt take from what we cant sistain
1	although fish is an important source of omega and more expensive alternatives are being studied.... sustainabilty is an important for everything we consider a resource.
0	yes becausewe need to keepouroceans full of fish
1	I would hope that we could put the future of our natural environment before profits. "when we have cut down the last tree & psoned the last river & caught the last fish - only then will we realise we cannot eat money."
0	supermarkets should  always sell sustainable foods.
0	I think excited because that is better for the planet and we are the once that made this problem so we have to fix it. and that is one way of helping the earth and us.
1	i hope it happens and it need not get more expensive

0	love sustainable fisheries and aquaculture ( the mst sustainable farmingpractice available). supermarkets should atleast tell us where the fish is caught - who caught it and the method of catch (SANFORD has the most sustainable nets under development and cought revolutionise wild catch bt needs the public to willingly pay more for better fish
0	The future of our oceans will be better protected
0	most consumers need to be led to making positive change through their buying power

0	our prices need to reflect the real cost
0	the way people are fishing right now are killing our eco system. Its good to see super markets standing up.
0	it would give struggling fish stocks a chance to replenish therefore benefiting all
0	for sure this ensures there are plenty more for future generations and we preserve the environment because it is our duty as occupents living on earth. we humans are good at takingand exploiting but we arent doing much to give back
3	Because we would have to pay more for something we can get fish for cheaper when they aren't caught as sustanably.
1	why shouldnt they if they want to continue selling fish they need to do it in a sustainable way or else 5  10 or 20  years down the track they wont have any fish to sell

0	thinking about nz's fiherys has always been a large concern as the populaion of fish is depleting at a rapid rate due to the ovr fishing from japanese and local fishermen. this is a huge problem and if we care nz get up ad fight to save our oceans.

0	the real question is why not
1	people might decide to help our stocks this way
0	bcause we are ruining our planet
1	because wipes out the sea bed
0	we need to make radical change and supermarkets are partially responsible for what they offer consumers
4	fishing  is not sustainable with the growing population. the oceans need timeto recover.
1	eating any kind of meat should be special and meat shouldnt be sooo cheap that people can easily afford it everyday
1	i believe we will have enough people to push this idea through
1	Fish should be happy fish before people eat thm bc YOLO
1	it is important to look after the natural world. Without sustainability there can be no future.
2	I'm not the one buying the food
3	How do we know if it is true
3	ih tink this is agood start
1	Because then less life dies in NZ.
0	becaus it is good for the envliroment and...... i guess thats the ony reason.

0	Because the aim is for sustainabiity to be the norm
4	I THINK IT IS NOT FAIR
2	i dont care cause i dont eat fish fish smells nasty so i hate fish
1	we should only sell sustainable fish because it would make the population of fish higher
1	hopefully through enough consumer education we can make this a reality
1	this is a good idea but consumers have to accept to eat less
0	if we understand the true cost
0	commercial fishing can be made much more sustainable than it currently is.
1	it means that eople will eat better food
2	not overly evironmently ebgaged as i should be
0	Sustainable fishing should be a global endeavour

4	this is not good to do we want fish in water
0	because i want to eat fish
0	This is good because it will preserve the fish populations and linked ecosystems.
3	ithink i am worried about the earthquake.
3	choice should be natural and progressive...not forced upon us.
0	it would eventually become normal to everyone that fish would be sold at a slightly higher price.
0	sustainable activities are important for future generations to thrive. we dont fish to be caught to quickly as this screws up the ecosystem
0	surfaiondin order to achieve a better environmental conditions for New Zealand . The mindset  of the new zealands economic welfare is need to be changed to achieve a true sustainability future. Reducing the mindset of economic growth focus on the needs of quilty of life for the earth and improving the planetary boundarie. Mass produce fishing is affect the eco system and thus reducing the qaulity of life for future conditions of all species living on this gobal ecosystem called earth
0	i think its a great dea because the cost if fiod shoukd reflect the value we place in our environment
1	it would be great but would also punish low icome earers because they are priced out of market
0	We have already put enough strain on the oceansfrom plastics
1	it should be done. however most people dont care about sustainability
3	i think supermarkets go for the cheapest sources. if the sustainable sources are more costly they will buy unsustainable instead
1	I think that all supermarkets should only sell sustainably caught fish. Those who really care won't mind paying more money.
1	there is a growing movement worldwide for food provenence
1	why is eating salmon or whatever so crucial that the species has to die out or only be farm raise? ridiculous and selfish
0	we do not benefit by short changing for gain when we can see what needs to happen to be good stewarts
0	to have any chance of enough food resources in the near future we need to ensure stocks are RESPONSIBLY managed
1	hopefully it turns out that way
0	so that the future generation will still get some fish
0	I am excited that sustainble choices are becoming easier to make and considered the best choice
1	it will hopefully stopother sea creatures unneccsarily dying
0	so there will always be fish to eat
1	hopefully if thesupermakets start making changes the peoplewill to
1	A sustinable future leads to a more successful future where humans and nature can work in harmony. Without nature humans will become extinct thmselves.
1	we  should be respectful of all living things.  i wouldchallenge eveyone to limit their meat and fish intake and eat more vegetarian       items
0	it is not okay to throw food out. everyhing expires. if we letthings run out instead of being fully stocked there would be less going to waste everyday.
1	Clearly its a complicated issue but trying to do something is better than nothing
0	I was very exited for the earthquake house.
1	So all our fish do not go extinct.
0	we are part of this world and should value it and respect it
0	sustainability is neccesary forthe future and we should pay what food is actually worth

0	i have not visited this museum fot five years because i live in Ecuador... happy to visit again
0	because it will help the planet
0	need to introduce more susainable practices even if they cost more or there will be no fish left
0	this i exciting because it is btter for the earth. it willhelp kep over oceans cleaner and will be better fr the fish asthey have longer to develop before being caught
3	large corporates corporate to governments and change in mindset will take generations
0	we need to find a way to make everything we consume sustainable for the planet
0	I think that if we eat  and farm endangered fish we would be ruining our oceans. Other sea creatures might eat that type of fish but at least it's not us. WE NEED TO HELP SAFE OUR PLANET.  NOT JUST FOR US BUT FOR GENERATIONS TO COME!!!
0	supermarkets should and have  the power to support ethical consumption
0	better for the planet and people
4	they shoud be left aone. its their home

0	because i hope you used vks-nako in the fortnite itemshop
0	so much of the oceans pollution is caused by fishing equipment and this would help reduce that
1	i feel that the fishing industry indanges the rest of the ocean and the creatures and i nee hope tgat one day my children will be able to live in a safe eco friendly society
0	if we want fish in the ocean we needto rethink our practices
3	because i feel sad for them
3	it is but a small step that will make little difference. a true difference would be to climb down the carbon ladder by switching to an all vegeterian diet. but we live in a world where individual comfort and pleasure outweighs the collective long term good. a tragedy of the commons
1	because commercial fishes are not sustainable today for most of them. we should make sure to not empty the ocean or the whole ecosystem is gonna pay the price of our poor food choice!
1	without sustainability stocks collapse. stock and flow...stock and flow
3	that they should be more nice to fish
0	we should all buy fish thathave been caught sustainably because we are likely to over fish therefore landing us with no more.

0	we don t need that many fish
3	i like theidea but i think the generational change reuired will never happen.
1	more pressure on fishers to catxh sustainabily and create a new social norm
1	it is better for us and our marine environment
1	also doubtful.. we have to stop being so greedy and selfish
1	sustainability is more important than mass consumerism

0	we need to realise thetrue value of our comodities.
1	ITS THE RIGHT THING TO DO

1	I doubt the world is gonna like that. I mean people get outraged at the weirdest thingsyet they do not do anything about it.  The media will always have something to say good or bad

1	it would be good for the environment
0	so baby fish can grow to be mummy fish
1	to keep the at risk fish species alive
1	that all fish sould deserve something good for them selves so danjerd and small fish sould not be eaten be me :) ; (
2	it doesn'tmatter becausejthere are soooo many fish
0	i think we should look after ourfish and only catch the fish we need
0	fish are usally wasted if it is more staianbaland people will care more about fish if supermarkets have sustanible fish it will help lots of people and the envoriment
1	depends on a new economic model.......
0	because i think fish are like people but we're destroying them and that's bad :(
1	I think that the fishing industry is far too taxing on the environment for us to continue unethical practices
0	overfishing is wrecking the marine environment and ecosystems. a large proportion of marine pollution is  a result of non sustainable fishing practice.
1	There are more important long term issues to worry about  than a price increase in fish We should invest in the future..
1	people are unwilling to do so because it costs more. i hope that people will come to their senses and realise how much of an affect it has on the environmet before its too late.
3	i like cheap fish and if thereis no cheap fish you are forcing me to go pescaterian :_(

1	i thibk it would be good because theb we will have more fish ib the sea abd earh will survive longer
1	I thnk they should be caught in our area and they should be fresh fish

1	i  think this is good because it balences the food chain
1	id like this to inicate the start of a movement towards sustainable agriculture supported from producer through supplier to seller and consumer.
0	Over fishing is depleatig the wild fish stocks and will cause an ecological collapse.
0	supermarkets and all retailers can lead by changing what they offer for sale.  if peoples choices are limited we can drive real change.  if it is more expensive we will eat less of it
1	This would be a better choice
0	ki ooku whakaaro. kaoree kore me haere tonu tatau i te ara o whakarauoratanga
0	i like men and im bi lol
1	help save us from climate and environment crises
1	we need to be more sustainable in order to have fish forthe future
1	its sensible . we dont need to eat fish anyway
1	this is a better way but we do need to feed the population and have a growing economy
1	future generations are starting to see the impact of their choices
0	because this earthis not just ours
1	i think that we need to be aware of what we put into te sea and what we take from it.
3	will they start to sell eel too?
1	i think itsreasnable so we are not depleting the fish resources to extention. otherwise we will run out quite fast and have nothing to harvest.
2	bc  i dont know y i am doing dis
0	so the fish dont get extinct
1	i think this is a good idea because if we keep catching fish on Puorpse there  wont be many left!!!!!!!!!
1	if everyone keeps catching fish on pourpose there wont be many fish left in our ocean!!!!!!!
1	that it should happen and even if it will cost more because when it becomes popular itwill cost less!! kpai nz we are going to be sustainable!!
0	Susutaiablefishing will help preserve our oceans for generations to come.
1	fish will be more natural but it will cost more
0	fish will be  more becase it is right
1	if everybody would be more mindful of theenvironment then maybe we can safe it
1	WE SHOULD JUST STOP FISHING FOR A WHILE
1	i  think we shod stop lllll
1	In order to continue to feed our people.
0	In this world we need to do our bestto  be conservative and make sure we don't lose any more species. Once the struggling populations recover then we can fish them again
0	creating sustainability starts in accessible supermarkets. by creating a system that actively aids sustainability we put natures worry and cares in the forefront of everyones minds. if we want a future that doesnt risk the loss of more life we have to work for it
0	we need to take care of the earth abd not upset the balance
1	oceans are huge and we should look afterthem
0	It may lead to higher costs right now but future generations will thank us...
1	we could keep on eating fish without them dying out.
1	It shows a commitment to a sustainable world
0	because our ocean is dying fast. we need to keep the fish population resiliant in the face of external stress such as climate change
1	most trawling fisheries often target a range of species instead of locating one
1	it means greater awareness and people will care more. and our fish will replenish
0	Im ready to pay more to save our planet
1	we need to manage our stock level.  quota levels are too high with wastage from big compaines
1	would rather a good product than a contamineted product. Even if the prces are impacted.

3	that the moa will eat me
0	as this will help the ocean to recover
4	i would like to have more touching things
0	The majority of plastic in the ocean is caused by fishing nets. Sustainably caught fish will prevent this even if taking meat out of your diet is the best option. It will also protect the widlife eg. tge Hectors dolphins and the Sei whale of which are threatened by the pollution of the plastic nets and are often caught accidentally.
0	fish that us not sustainably caught can impact catching sharks and hector dolhins also. Farmed fish cotains antibiotics that are toxic to humans and will make us immune. Ocean fish shoud also not be caught as It contins microplastics which will transfer into the human blood strean and cause cancer
1	The fresher the fish the more the buyers
3	not. many family can afford fishso we catch it ourselves
1	because it might help to sustain our fisheries
1	and hope there is enough time.  Knowledge is moving quickly we are learning.  More public advertising our plight.
1	it is importabt to save tge earth
1	it can be a good step to save marine life
1	because the more people who care the better
3	because they dont know what sustainable is
1	It is a step in the right direction. it will take awhile to make it happen but hopefully it can be successful
1	we need to be conserned what we do to our ocean and less conserned about the money in our pockets.
0	fish species will rosper again with controlle fishing
0	because its important to look after our waters and our planet
0	we are destroying fish populations if theindustryisnotregulated
1	The maribe ecosystem is fragile and requires protection. Over fishing is a serious problem we need to solve
0	It will help with the conservation of species
0	it means that our larger businesses are more invested in our future
0	we need to be living in a sustainable manner without the greed of neoliberal capitalism

4	how can we know this is even a good idea what evidence is there to show that this works well and will be a great qoute i will make supermarkets great again Donald J Trump and for the record i respect wamen especially fine lookin ones
0	that is the way of the future.
1	we need to be proactive about protecting our environment
1	if what we did to the orange roughy is an example of human greed in modern times we have a responsibility to ensure it never happens again.
1	i wish this could become rel one day
0	short of everyone reducing all meat consumtion the next focus would be on sustainability and environmental support
4	we should stop eating fish entirely.
0	Because seafood is such a big part of maori culture and i want it to stay around for my kids and my kids kids
0	sustainability of our ika is so important if we want to be good  kaitiaki of our waterways  and our ika.
1	because we need to  care about all animals
0	it is mportant to protect NZ fisheries and peservethem for future generations
1	i think the seafood industryhave too much invesred in old world desrtuctive fishing methods. and rather than investing in improved metjods the invest in lobbying politicians ( corruption)
0	farmed fish is terrible for you. the mass production of them makes them more diseased and consequently more medicated. also fish pellets made out of smaller fish have high mercury levels which become more concentrated as it goes up the food chain.
1	we should know the worth of it
1	fish r gross screw feferi rights tbh
0	fish are lads ###### is just a douche
0	because we need to look after ur ocean.
0	a cyclical sustainable approach is the only way forward for our generations to come.
3	selling any fish is notgood for the environment
0	80 percent of fish stocks are overfished. the fish meat is full of microplastics. so... maybe we shouldnt be eating fish at all
0	i like that they are lots of cool animals and i get lern from them
1	We shold think about our actions. And we shuld be a bit morecareful on what we are doing.
0	hopefully this will increase numbers and save extinction
1	it manes you are hopeful and kind
1	it means you really want something to hapen but your not to sure its going to hapen
0	because overfshing is a erious issue that poses a great threat to our envionment and aquatic ecolife. also the pollution of fishing materials within our sea is too extreme for us to ignore
1	eventually prices would go down andits better fortheplanet
1	the fishing business overseas is appauling and dangering our sea life. im hoping theywill follow suit
1	it willsave the enviroment becausei dont want to die
4	i dont really like da fishy smell ?®®
0	it is wierd to eat but it tastes gucci
0	its better because       people      are     a    problem    .
0	that cake is good for u
0	the cost of fish vs the planet it is a no brainer. we have the obligation to do all we can do to help the planet. this step helps the environment as well as helping our health.
1	I think hunger for consumerist culture under capitalism will not fully allow such measures to be taken. But I'd like to be hopeful for change because it would be nice not to wreck the environment and cause human extinction.
1	i have worked on deepsea fishing vessels and i have seen the destruction first hand i believe all commercial fishing should be banned for atleast 5 years
1	that way fish wont go extinct and we will be able to continue eatingthen
1	SEA IS GOING TO DIE IF WE DNT STOP OVERFISHING
4	if it can swim it can win
0	its our earth we use on adailybasis so why shouldn't we protect it. our future is priceless and the fish need to be around for future generations
0	we need to protect natural resources
0	becase marine harvesting fsh would be less so more fish can grow
1	itis  horrible how someanimals are treated
1	its important to maintain our resources and preserve what we have
0	This applies to all marine life. It is important to try to maintain an ecologically balanced ocean as it will preserve our environmental flora and fauna
0	we want to keep the sea alive
1	coz  it means less injurged cheap fish
1	better for the inviroment and it doesnt matter how excpencive
1	this would change things dramtically for the better
0	the future of fishis really in our hands then
1	we only have one planet with no known plan B. It simply makes sense to protect our resources and treasure our Taonga
0	sustainably caught ensures we have ika in the future
1	responsible sourcing inspires peopleto think about other products theyconsume and their supply chain
1	you shoud not catch to meny fish
0	If we promote unsustainable practices eventually the supply will decrease so that the price increases anyway. We should be sustainable as an expectation not a extra.
1	we need to be more aware of taking care of our kaimoana
0	the people needs to be more involved to take care of the planet.
1	cant let the fishies go extinct!
2	fish should just live in the ocen wheregod placed them
2	fish dont have an opinion. theydnt creh
2	fish will die anyway. they dont care how. as long as its environmently friendy.
1	it will help keep fish stocks safe for future.
1	overseas companies would come in and exploit our fisheries and sell it  to us for discounted rates
0	if we want to continue eating fish it is our only hope
0	preserve resources for the  future of humanity
0	Papatuanuku needs love care and patience. Our puku need only vegies.
1	so future generations havefish to eat
0	so wecan see the colorful fish
0	i think we should put a stop to commercal fishing because we are not only catching to much fish it is also very bad for the enviroment.
0	Id like to think we are willing to pay a bit more to help preserve our resources for future generations.
4	i think they shouldnt sell fish at all
1	people will be more thoughtful and reduce consumption
0	it is morally corrupt if you dont agree
1	because it will be better for our environment.
0	the earth is dying and its our fault
1	all products that are sold in supermarkets should be sourced sustainably if we are actually wanting to stop our planet and natural resources from being destroyed
1	lets be the first generation in Aotearoa to pass on a healthier fishery to our children. step 1.  Get rid of the failed QMS
0	This would help make fishing more sustainable again. iti s still not as good as all of us going vegetarian/vegan - but it is a good solution for in the meantime and better than no change at all. Going vegan or at least vegetarian will be the only sustainable solution in the long run though.
1	hopeful because it would be a step in the right direction. i personally don't think 'sustainable' fishing is possible on a large scale and it would be large scale if it were sold in supermarkets. More sustainable would of course be better than exploited  but essentially I think we   need to move away from having animals and animal products as a stable food in our diets if we want to support our eco systems and our  own future existance.
1	bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh
1	bruhbruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh
0	so tha t d fish species on d way to extincion hv time to regenerate
1	because fish are a vital food source and if we over fish then we will run out
0	too much for me to know aoutwhichfish are sustainable so i now just never buy at spermarkets
2	they should sell aforable yummy food
3	that people can no longer buy food that is nutricious because of the price
1	we need to manage fish stocks sustainably
0	need to look after our planet
1	because we need to look after them fishey bois
1	because humans should stop puttng their wants over whats best for the enviorment. our waters need to recover because overwise there wont be fish to eat at all at some point.
0	diversity is in danger..fish species need our help
1	the fish need more poplipsin after mass fishing.
1	i think its a good idea.
1	my salt and vinigger chips gone
2	i dont buy fish. cop us a hoki fish and chips mate
0	we have plenty of resources to survive without extincting spiecies
1	fishing is bad enough by its self.so why hurt other fish and marinelife too.
1	this would be good.  we really shoud be cutting down completly on all animal products.
0	because if we overfish we dont get a second chance
1	because theres a 50 percent chance of it working
1	the fish sould be better quality
1	because there are not enough fish in the ocean/sea
1	i like the sound of  this idea!
4	i dont get why they shuld sell the kaimoana when youre stealing it from tangaroa
1	it would help the species of fish that are going extinct
1	New Zealand shoud be a rolemodel.
1	The fishing industry in new zealand isnt sustainable. We need to take better care of what the world has given to us
0	It is the right thing to do so that future generations can enjoy them too
0	bc otherwise wewont have any fish if sustainable  fishing is not practised
4	we dont need to eat fish at all
4	humans should not be eating fish at all if we don't  want to see fishless oceans in the near future
2	the healthiest diet is a whole food plant based det. fish contain toxic heavy metals and cancer causing TMAO. not eating ANY fsh is the best safest most-healthy option
1	We  should protect our fish species for the future.
1	It's the right thing to do but can we collectively look past the added costs?
1	overfishing is an issue tht needs to be adressed
1	it means to me that people are willing to make changefor a greater future
1	Hoeful because awareness is growing which will change behaviour of future generations
3	i am worried that all of the animals will die.
1	ur mum ### and ur dad ###
0	my dad  is ###### and my friends name is ######
0	i dont  konw what this question is so yeah it just says tell me why
0	we need to look out for our future
0	I think sustainable fishing helps to have supply and maintain the environment too.
1	because it shows a growing care for our environment and our inpact on the seas.
1	that it is important to keep this planet alive
1	cos thats prob not gonna happen
0	because the fishies will  happier abd so will i :)
1	need to preserve the fsh life
2	i think fish ae cool but i like u.s.as ###
1	I think its a good idea. If we cant prove that we are mature enough to use a resourse wisely and in a manner which promotes their sustained existance then we shouldnt be using it. We shouldnt play god and decide which species survive and which dont.
1	I  think there should be strict minimum standardse for sustainability. We could sell  cheaper cars by removig airbags but no one would argue that it would b a good idea. Climate issues are nowan issueof public safety. Themore we reduce our consumption of animals the better
0	we need to start becoing sustainable in order to save animals and the planet
0	sustanibility is the only way or there will be nothing left
3	s t e a m e d   h a m s
0	we should only support fullytraceable sustainable seafood options. all else should stay in the moana or awa.
1	im hopeful but concerned that profit will continue to be put first
1	nice and all but what are we gonna do about global warming now
0	planet is dying it would be stupid to oppose
0	we are overfishing. stocks wont last foeever. plus if we fish sustainably that will be good news for mauis dolphin
1	We need to ensure we protect our fish population however we can. The hard bit is protecting jobs and livilihoods of fishermen too...
1	sea lufe is an incrediblesource ofbiodiversity we must do our utmost to protect it for future generations and to absolveus of our guilt.
1	sea life is important I dont   want to imagibea workdwithoutit
0	im more likely to eat  fish than usea straw and one is wayworse for the environment
1	we need to protect our ocean
0	the ocean need our protection and respect
3	what if the fish go extinct
1	it would allow stock to recover
0	we need to save resources for our future.
2	its ok to dow fish frams cause fish can bred fast
1	this is a very good idea!
0	it makes us more accountable for what we eat
4	Because I a gree with this statent as we need to do everything we can sustain our planet and what it provides to us
0	because we need to sustain and protect every area ofnature
1	i think even though fish are smaller and weaker than us that doesntmeanweshould misstreat them
1	over and unsustainable fishing will eventually lead to the demise of al life. Life is a cycle of relationships. As we relate to the planet we relate to all its inhabitants.
2	#### will be a silver fern
4	#### will definetlybe a black cap
4	I love fish as an animal!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	i do not care because i love ice cream and thats all that matters bruh
2	I DONT CARE ALL THAT MATTERS IS CATS BRO
1	i love fish and it is yummy and that is all that matters so fish is your life bruh!!!
0	it is bad for the ecology of the ocean the way it is done now and fish are sold that dont need to be. i alsoworkin a supermarket and hate fish
1	its sustainable. a small price to pay to help the enviroment
0	idont like fish to be caught
1	people would like to see this happen but it might cost a bit too much
3	we should go back to basics. plant and hunt our own food. this would make a whole difference.
1	we need to stop producing over food. in any areas.
1	it is the right thing to do
0	It is impotant to protect our eco system and continue the abilty for our future generations to fish
0	it is good because of sustainibility
0	it  is better for our world and  us
1	HOPE THIS PLACE GETS BETER IN A GOOD WAY
4	idc lol dab hit the woah
1	i think this isimportant for feeding ourselves in the future
0	I think that everybody should be sustainable.
0	vegan is love. vegan is life
1	itll help the environment in the long run
1	this is important and i am hopefulthat we are abke to protect our ocean
0	because we are winning in the compatiton
1	we should look after our community well being. our health is very important for generations to come. eating good food is the best way to sustain a long healthy life.
1	beacause there wont be any more fishys left
1	there wont be any fish left
0	because fishes also need to live
0	its good cos the earth is lit rally dying rn lol stream megatron
1	we need to the of the long term affects.secure our future generations
1	the fish in our sea are disappearing. save wildlife
0	Sustainabity is vital to our planets survival...duh
1	we are resposible for lifein our planet.  we do not know how it  is going affect  future generation
1	people have to let go of self gain
1	It is good for the enviroment
1	because then we wont run ut of fish in the water
1	more fish for me to catch :)
0	total catch under reporting is chronic
0	we shuld take care our resources no mater the cost
1	ould be nice to knw the quality was there and it wasnt just rapped fromthe sea
0	my name is ############### and i hve a passin for helping people. i love to make theword a better place
0	if we want them forever we shoul look after them now
0	they are abe to help us make this choice more easily by making it more accessible
0	BECAUSE THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES WE CAN EAT OTHER THEN SEAFOOD
0	people should stop consuming and producing so much animal product
0	People need to understand the reources that we have and that we are abusing them
0	This would mean the environment is able to last longer will fishery production is maintained
1	i think it will take a lot of work to make this happen but it its a change we need tomake
1	helping sustain the environment withut total envorimentall collapse
0	sustaining the environment without killing all thprettybirds
0	because we need protection for our oceans
0	necessary. if we cant afford it we shouldnt be doing it. need to cost in the externalities of our food supply.
1	better for the ocean therefore better for earth cycle
0	If we dnt we will never have fis to eat agai
1	that it is a good idea but I dont know if  it will work
0	it means fish wont be wasted and will be able to produce    more
1	the more endangered fish would be more likely to survive
0	onlywhen the last fish hasbeen caught will we care
0	it is more important to sustain our eco system than to eat cheap fish. There are still many ways to be fed than killing an eco system
4	only fish shop shoul sell they have alotof wastage
0	i think that fish lives matter too so we souldorry and protect them
0	i  think that fish are b?®t®f®l
2	hey do you know ###   who is ###   ### #### hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
4	THE MCDONALDSS ICE CREN NACHINE WAS BROKE
0	everything they sell should be from sustainable sources.
0	screw money. our planet comes first
3	porque estan extinguiendo mas de lo necesario. si la produccion es sustentable no deberia elevar el precio ya que tiene que ser accesible
0	sustainability is important for the environment and our future
0	i think that  it is a good idea.
0	we will run out of fish
1	i think thisbecause then there will bemorefish to breed so then we willhave fishbut not over   loaded with fish becauseifweoverloadwithfishing then thefushwont breed as much so itsmaking us have less fish
0	IT IS VITAL THAT WE FISH SUSTAINABLY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS AND TO PROTECT OUR MARINE BIODIVERSITY.
1	the population of fish is low from overfishing. it would be fantastic
1	overfishing destroysecosystems and harms the oceans  . thatshould be cahnged
1	Hopeful. A difficult transition but a needed one for our earth.
0	the fishing industry is one of the worst for sustainability. emptying our oceans for profit. This needs to stop
1	Because the Earth is dying. Our first priority should be to save it. But I have no hope when it comes to the people currently in power. They will never have to face the consequences of the world they have created.
0	well we arnt going to survie
1	because it will help sea life thrive
1	because i believe the commercial fishing industry is dangerously overfishing and its obvious when you go to the supermarket and and see fish that are barely legal. sometimes even undersized
1	cause people love fish but cant afford it
2	its still food to sustain us
0	i also think thatwill depletethe oceans aswell. sustainable s good but we are still not honouring the great motherearth who provides for us
4	oh hi how to do have
1	I see thusbeing dscussed more and more
3	i think by 2050 more plastic than fish
2	that if you look at this your ###
0	if we dont buy it they wont catch it
0	not that much people will eat it
0	so the sea has fish for people catch with family
0	fish numbers are dwindling and retailers need to put pressure on suppliers  to be resonsible in their fishing techniques consumers must also drive this change.  then maybe fish have a chance
0	SO WE CAN EAT FISH IN THE FUTURE
1	beause its better t have fresh fish then old fish
2	cause its pointless not our descision at the end of the  day
0	Itis the only way to perserve the fish the sea and our environment
1	they should sell it for a reasonable  price in all supermarkets
1	we should leave the world a better place for our children
0	that we shoud not be eating fish because i think that we coud over fish and thats bad
1	to prevent disruption to  the ecosystem and to prevent extinction of a species.
0	go vegan. were the last hope of saving this world as we know it
0	we have tomake a stand. and nmake the small sacrifices for great gain forour planet
0	there is so much wasted in a catch. so many species are being caught and thrown back dead.this was told to me by a commercial fisherman
0	because why shouldnt they?? its ridiculous that this is even a debate. FACT.
0	we cant continue to impose our luxurious lifestyles at the expense and extinction of other animals that have as many years evolutionary rights to be here as we do
0	at the least fish population is saved
1	i believe it offers new prospects for the future
1	i hope that this will ignite some serious change.
0	this will improve sustanability of fish species
1	to stop the pilaging of our natural resource
4	this is an actof stupietdy they have no self intrest
3	it is not fair to the fish
4	it is not far to any animal
3	when u kill fish it lowers population to sea life it is not fair on others
4	it will be hard to convince other kiwis to stop what is happening but i am happy these comments to share each others fellings but yeah just stop eating fish!!!!!!
4	everyone should be vegan and care about animals
1	i need the help of regulatory measures like this because i cant spend the timedoing enough research to makereally good choices
0	We need to preserve the bio diversity of our oceans to keep the natural balance and good health of the ecosystems there. It is irresponsible and short sighted to over fish various species.
0	time for people to wake up
0	we all need to do better
0	we need to look after mother earth and she will look after us
1	maybe this is a step towards no fish at all. we are at a time in human historywhere animal meat consumption is no longer a requirement for survival
1	animals should not be killed for food when we thrive on plants based diets. flesh diets are no longer a necessity for our survival in the majority of the world. why make them suffer horrific fates when eating them fuels disease. nothing humane happens in a slaughterhouse.
1	i dont eat fish bt id feel mre comfortable eating fish if i knew it wasnt detriental to the ocean
0	because we are going to run out of fish and cause mass extinction
1	agree if people want to eat fish it should be sustainable and cost them more money rather than unsustainable and cost the health of our oceans
1	it wouldkeep balancefor all ecosystems. We should alsolearn how to eat less quantity and better quality
0	It will give ourfisherys a chance to grow
3	i think that we should be more safe because if you are worried then you die be safe
1	that it will help bost are fish population
1	try make less fish get caught
1	we should try to be sustainable
3	iam worried that fish die out
0	we need to move towards a sustainable future
0	Because that might help people appreciate fish more. I wished people were more aware of what theyre eating
3	because there will be nothing left
0	simple eqations..... outsouce the ocean of fish not only will we not hve fish to eat we will kill our fragile eco system KILLING OURSELVES
1	it is essential that we try to save the species we can
0	it should obvious. commercial fishing rapes the bottom
1	the ocean balance is integral to our world. i hope we wake up
1	i t is important that we look after our environment. All creatures play a part .Wened toalso protect our food sources.
1	quality of fish and environmenta lsustainability
3	we are destroying our eco system
1	cause fish deserve a good iife before death
3	There isn't enough incentive to do the right thing by companies. New Zealanders are really price sensitive which makesit difficult to past the cost of sustainable practices along.
1	so that there are fish to clean our ocean still and in the future we still h fish to eat!!!
0	I LOVE FISH AND THAT FISH CAN CLEAN OUR OCEANS. ALSO THAT WE LOOK AFTER OUR OCEANS AND MAKE OUR FUTURE BETTER THAN NOW.
1	I LOVE FISH AND I HOPE THERE WILL BE MUSCLES IN THE FUTURE SO THAT THE CAN CLEAN OUR OCEANS!
0	i am exited because if you did not know we are LIVING just saying i am Av kete pehea  k?!!!
0	Ika need to be accessible for all we must sustain our source
1	i like fish but  sustainably  caught fish could be bad :)
1	###### ###### crap ##### fishp  i crap ####
1	this sould be a good idea because to many fish are getting caught. I think you know the song fishfor the furture and tere will always be kai moana for you and me
0	we rely on fisheries and if we overfish to the loss of fish species it is to everyones detriment.
0	depleting the oceon of its environment and inhabitants shouldn't be an option no matter how you look at it
0	because w can buy stuff in it
0	we shouldn't eat packaged animals from unknown origin
0	we soukd appreciate the intrnsic value of other lifeforms
0	The moana needs to be sustained as it is a life force and our ancestor. living in Aotearoa we need to be kaitiaki to te taiao
0	we have to protect our oceans from unrestrained over fishing. sustainable practices encorage this
0	bbcause the ocean is the literal lung of this planet
0	is there even such a thing as sustainable fishing on a large scale? there will always be bycatch - are we really willing to put our important and threatened marine species at further risk? if you want fish then catch it yourself.
0	because the ocean is the literal lung of this planet and disrupting its system by overfishing speeds up the death of this planet
0	because its a step in the right direction
0	we should be accountable for what we eat
1	i want our sea life to thrive
0	because it will help sertain fish that are near extinction
2	follow @########.### I need more followers
0	because people are thinking about positive change
1	we need to save the whale
1	I am hopeful that this will become our reality so that we may continue to lessen our impact on the oceans and their native creatures.
0	we have to aim for sustainability or the future is hopeless in the long run
0	do away with supermarkets and profit driven systems altogether. Lets find ways live sustainably and equitably together - as Te Tiriti envisaged!
1	sustainble means it can continue. howeverit is done this should be achievedso that we don't run out.
0	I think we need to realise the enviromental effect.
1	to maintain safe numbers in the hope our kids kids will have a chance to eat our amazing food
0	its something that should all ready be a thing.our fish need to last us a long time the least we could do is let them sustain themslves abd us.
1	it wuld help keep sea diversity!
3	fish is healthy and should not be too expensive.
0	Because we should care about the environment.
0	simply necessary if fish are to survive.
1	i think im worried the foodprice goingto be high
1	I think this could really make a difference.
1	i think we need to sustain for thefuture
0	fish are veryimportant to the ecosysten and if we dont look fter them soon there is going to be a big problem
2	because i dont make enouh to be able to afford it. plus the option is kinda already there
0	i dont eat muchfish any more because of this so it would be great to be sure of what im eating
1	i hope we can get  there in the usa. i think we will need regulations to do so.
2	##### is full of#### and brainwashed aspergers
2	climate chabge is fakeand madeup by th elites
2	the green party are the elites and ##### cheated on hr boyfriend for a female press secratary
1	cuz eating plastic doesnt sound fun
0	we need to push consumers twards change
2	cause godg ave us dominion over the animal xd
0	people should catch their own so the only take what they need
1	we need to make systemic changes
1	i feel thisis good because it is
1	this is good ecsuse it is better for the environment and also it is sustainable.yeet
1	because  im going to geta new ps4
1	we have to consume as a race yet conserve. however we must keep it affordable for all
1	beause  there ar more ofthis kindof  fish so we wont run out of fish
0	sustainability is what will keep the human race alive. if not we will drive ourselves extinct
0	fish should be fished in a more sustainable way. over fishing is ruining the ocean.
1	the fishing industry is the single biggest source of ocean plastic
0	so people can stay alive and healthy
3	i don't know whats the question
1	it means we are paying attention the the earths needs.
1	it matters to all f utures
1	We have the option now to choose sustainably caught species. If we dont take it there willcome a time where the option is gone. Then all seafood (and all food) will be expensive and there will be nothing left to about it
0	because there will be fish toeat forfuture .generations. itjustmakes sense.
0	fish populations can recover quickly but we dont give them a chance to with current commercial fishing
1	There is no need for unsustainable fishing practice to make it into our supermarkets. We dont NEED unsustainable fish!
0	best option. we need to stop eating fish altogether. our oceans are dying
1	because we need to eat way less fish to conserve our oceans
0	really wanna  meet ####### lower  that tax rate
0	because we dont want fish to become extinct
0	because it is better for the environment and more sustainable
0	i think that it s innaporiate to still be buying unstainably caught fish after all the warning sign we've seen. surprised is not a luxury we deserve anymore.
0	because my topic at school is realated to the question and I believe in it
1	if we want fish for future generations we need to ensure what we catch and eatis sustainable. we need to stop being greedy
1	Over fishing and production of smaller fish is unsustainable. If supermarkets bought from local fishermen (or as local as possible) is better for the sustainability of the fish and local businesses too x
4	WE ARE EATING PLASTIC WHEN WE EAT SUPERMARKET FISH.STOP EATING IT!
0	i think i am very excited
2	its a good idea but should not have more
1	change the attitude. change the world
2	because i dont store bought fish.  i catch it my self
0	More moral than not doing so.
0	If its not in the market demand will die out. Surely if you want some tarakihi you can grab a rod and catch one yourself.
1	because it means things are changing for the better and there is hope for  the future
1	Because I think it is more important than ever to protect the environment and conserve species and this makes me hopeful that we can make a difference before it is too late.
1	it means that the wildlife is being protected and no other animals will be harmed while fishing.  things will be changing for the better
1	It is good if they are using sustainably caught fish because then the fish are not getting harmed too much and other animals will have a better chance of survival!
3	I fell worried because they shouldnt be killing fish anyway. Soon fish will probaly be exicted becuse of all the people that are killing the fish in NewZealand. They shoudnt be selling them in the supermarket anymore even know they are very tasy.
0	better for us and the ocean
0	it is so FUN!!!!! and COOL!!!

2	Because it dosent matter if its cuaght freash it only matters if people have food.
0	I think it is a good idea because it could help increase and sustain the number of fish in our rivers
0	BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE ALL SPECIES OF FISH TO BE AROUND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO ENJOY
1	the fish will be healthier than they ar ecurrently thus should be tastier.
0	because this is best for the fish and our future food sources
1	i think this would help to keep fish alive
0	becuse we can survie with every species

1	This is a stepin the rightdirection .
0	there will be more fish of that kind
0	this museam is coole than the auckland museam
1	Only hopeful as how couldyoutrust the government or profit driven super markets.
2	Don't get me wrong. I would like it if everybody caught fish sustainably but I think there are bigger problems to deal with (climate change. saving our birds etc.) In my opinion should sort out native birds and reptiles before worrying about fish
0	we should be doing our upmost to protect environment
1	i would rather no fish be sold but if you have to have fish it needs to be sustainable
1	this is the way to go...but th definition of 'sustainably caught'needs caefrul thinking. it shoukd be about ecosystem sustainability not just sustainability from an economic lens
0	its not just consumers that should be ethical our retailers should be too
1	we need to take steps to protect our oceans. every little helps
1	we need to ake oactiob now
0	supermarkets are key to mainstreaming sustainability
1	so the fish dont go extinct
0	Our fish stocks are vital to the health of the sea - along with all the other creaturse that make the sea their home. If we are to eat fish or other kai moana we need to do it carefully and mindfully forthe health of the fish and the ecosystem.
1	im worried about thesustainability of new zealand sea life
1	I like to believe that humans can achieve this and am hopeful that we can rise above our greed and learn to live sustainably in harmony with nature.
1	enough people care about this - it would be great if this happened
1	sustainable fish is a goodidea but increased costs would mean that many people couldn't afford it
0	if its easier and better for the enviroment than why not. using a sustainable food source is a great idea
1	most firms prioritise profits over sustainability
1	it would benfit the enviroment and also   we know more about where  our food comes from
1	because it would  be better for the enviorment and such b
1	i think helpful is nice to help each other
0	because i think this mueseum is awesome
1	we cant run out of fish... butits going to happen at the rate were going
0	why not. also i dont eat fish often
0	i think we need to preserve our fish stocks!
0	I think I would like mychildren tosee fish in the oceans. i am #!
0	we need toconserve wildife for future generation. it would be a crime to deprive them with the oppurtuinity.
2	all food is good aslong as its not poisonous.underweight or endangered.
2	jesus love you guys alot and he is the only way to life. john 3.16 . if u dont follow him you are dam to hell
4	we should  take only sustainable  as we dont know all the inputs in a wild fishery how can any of them be sustainable
0	because overfishing  is a huge problem especially around nzwaters
0	fishing nets are a top contributer to ocean plastics
0	yay lets  hve more fish in the ocean so numbers and specie can carry on to benifit all sea creatures  and our future
0	We should only eat food that can be reproduced.
0	long overdue and a no brainer.
4	We should not eat fish at all.
0	because we need to eat good things
0	we need to conserve our marine life
1	Not educated enough on the subject to know that its practical but i hope it is
4	fish are me friends back off
0	because then the ocean will be more  beutifull
4	because im so poor i have to take out a loan t sleep
3	I Like To Move It Move It.
3	if its expensive then people cant buy fish especially poor family. fish is good for your health so people need to eatfish not only meat. sell ONLY sustainably caught fish is not good idea.
0	SUSTAINABILITY IS NORE MPORTANT THAN PROFITS
1	i am anti all forms of fishing but am all for sistainablty if people still wish to eat fish
0	that ut us ruining the natural circle of life for other organisms
1	It should hopefully stop people from overfishing and lowering fish populations!
1	commercial fishing is harmful for the planet. any effort to put a stop to it is positive so i am hopeful that something happens
0	i think it is important for our sea life as the fishibg industryis harmful to marinlife and our oceans
3	affordabiity issues since not all could afford more expensive fish
1	I really hope this works to save the world
0	we needto protect our marine ecology regardless of the cost
1	ithink  we should not eat fish in general
3	it could be bad for the econimy
4	bcause people wont be able afford fish anymoreif theprice rises too high
0	Its the only way to preserve species for the future
1	that is a great idea. please bring it forwardto supermarket
1	because we need to take action and this is a good place to start
0	id rather eat sustainable food but pay mre than eat food that has been pillaged
0	we have wrecked our world.  now we need to fix it
1	te hunga o kaks haha #### sux bae

2	the grandpacer test is a test of endurance wits and beatng kaks at a rfl required fitness level lol ghee sux
0	beause we need to keep the environment safe for further genorations
1	this would be great for future gener
0	this would be good for nz so we can protect our amazing fish PROTECT OUR FISH
0	i think that this  will be good for nz fish  because it will make our native species   not become extinct
0	I believe that becauseit helps the enviroment sustaining our wild life and protecting our oceans.                                      #Excited about Learning
1	because i think its imortnt to sustain our oceabs and its wildlof.  w e need tolook after it bcase once t isgoewe cab get it back
1	because if supermarkets catch all the fish then i wont be able to catch any
3	then i wnt be able to buy the fs frn the supecause im broke
1	overfishing may stop people being able to source fully sustainable fish in enough quantities to supply the market
0	im kewl and u r weird hahahahahaha im actually not hahah im dead inside
4	### got rid of my photo
1	i would like it to happen but will people pay and will supermarkets do it. it needs to be a whole system approach. sustainable fishing practices and knowlegiable responsible market
1	want to live na sustainable way
1	consumers should demand so this change can happen
1	it is a hard ask however if it is properly funded we can do it
0	we are the kaitiakitanga of our land and need to look after our land. if it is funded it willhelp our smaller fishermen too.
4	no fish should be sold at all. eat plant based
1	it would be a great step into our future of sustainability and the protection of our eco-systems
1	There is too much at risk for future gens to dismiss practiceable action.
1	we need to bemoresustainable and care for our planet
0	because we as consumers shoudnt be afraid where our food comes from.
0	WE DONT NEED TOEAT FISH THATARE ENDANGERED WHEN TEREARE OTHER SPECIES AVAILABLE. I HACVE STPPED ORDERING TERAKAHI FROM MY LOCAJL TAKEAWAY
0	we should look after our ocean environments.
1	I am hopeful because I hink this solution could appeal to the most people.
1	its never too late to try
0	because the maintainace of sustainably quotaed and fisheries infrastructure is crucial to the biodiversity of New Zealand waters
3	i dont think it will work
1	i like to coat myself in fish oil and wail
1	i think that this is a good idea but unsurehow realistic it is
0	im so excited to see the exhibit
0	I am  very exited to seeit.
4	i  do not like the way they tret them$$$$$$$$$$$
1	because i love fish and i dont want them to go ecstinct
0	long term sustainability wll ensure ntergenerational equality of rescources
0	it is healthier for us and safer for the oceans and fish
1	that i dont have a bad concussion
0	Excited because then the futuregenerations will also be able to eat fish.
1	if we start making changes now then therewill be fishinthefuture
2	it should be fresh from the ocean only notfrozen
0	it's ridiculous that we would still support fishing  practices that are driving so many species to extinction
0	i want to keep eatingfish not have it run out
1	If we dont take steps we wont have another choice soon.
1	I feel hopeful towards the idea of sustainable fish recources because I don't want fish that live in creeks or are not properly farmed to die. I really hope this will happen as it will go towards a more environmentally friendly world.
3	I feel sad because fish should live not die.
0	Because its good for the environment?
0	sustainable food is better for the soul
1	its better for the envirnment and someonepays the price eventually
0	it is the responsible thing to do
1	limitations have been needed for a long time. converations have begun and the era of change is here
1	these sorts of restrictions are needed if our planet has any chance at survival
0	it isimportant to fish sustainaby to maintain balance in our ecosystems
1	we need to protect our ocens. sellig sustainable seafood is a necessary step to doing this and making a small but impactful difference to protecting our environment.
0	because it keeps most of the population and doesn't kill off most of the population so we don't have them extinct because I want I want to have fish around when I'm older
1	when theres no more well NO MORE
1	we should only use wat we can naturally maintain
0	i want to be able to continue enjoying the ocean and fish formany years still
3	because  if i bring the giant moas back people might hunt them again
0	sustainability means continued good quality of life potentially for all.
0	it will mean the stocks can recover and recreational will be easier and more fun
0	The oceans are finite resource we depend on for survival. We have to keep the environment healthy and balanced to preserve it for future generations.
1	we have to live in harmony with nature
0	imortant to consume food considering future generations and the health and longevityof our oceans. thisisnt justfor the pubkic and theoceans interest. it shoukd beofcorporate interest to
0	the ocean is an important part of the worlds environment. we should be doing everything we can to keep it clean. supermarkets can have an large influence on this as they are large companies in society. people will feel better about purchasing sustainable fish at a higher price and it is convientent to purchase in the supermarket
1	i wish humanity would let sealife population grow again
1	We need to be accountable and conscious of our impact. I just don't trust producers to be honest.
1	Convenience is a killer. We can have too much of a good thing. We need to find a better balance between nature and our food supplies.
0	we shukd mintai our sea lif.
0	we NEED TO LOOK AFTER OUR OCEANS
0	because i just like to be sustainable
1	need to keep diversity in our oceans and control over fishingmethods
1	itis an important step toward sustainability... but while people struggle to afford nutritious food there will be opposition to these types of ideas
3	i  have no idea what thequestion is about so stop
0	it will help restore fish numbers in the ocean
0	As this reduces the waste and even if the catch isn't what was on the captains catch list he shouldn't just throw it away but be included as final catch
0	It as a anazing time to have fun
2	i dont know and i dont care
0	stop over fishing and endagering our dolphins
1	such a vitalbattle to fight but commercialism is powerful and often faster tan policy
1	So we can sustain the fishing industry going forward
1	because iuu fishing isbadand the unsustainable fish will not be abletoreproduce beforebeing caught
1	because they are part of nature and i dont want them being eaten
0	there are other protein and vitamin sources which ae available at a low cost and are farmed sustainably. Therefore raising the price of fish and ensuring sustainable fisheries will benefit the planet without necessarily having a negative impact on human health. lets do it.
1	people are finally becoming aware that we are either partof the solution or part of the problem and time is running out.
1	once fish stocks have disappeared the whole world will change
1	we need to preserve species for the future generations
0	deep sea trawling is ruining the ecsystem
4	becase nz needs toget there damn act together!!!!
0	if we dont find a way to eat sustainably there will be nothing left to eat
1	i would like to see the ocean eco system preserved
2	ireally lik all sorts of fish
0	becauseits important for or future ecosystems survivle
0	yes. our children need fsh in the future. save now for them
3	All creatures have a purpose and a place. Failure to recognise this creates imbalance.
0	we need to protect the fish
3	because all the fish will die
0	i think tis is so important
1	to ensure fish for future generations
1	the commercial solution will be challengng
0	its much better for the planet and will reducethe amount of fish caught
2	fish fingers and beans should be a mandatory staple of everyones diet
1	go catch fish yourself if its to expensive
2	itchin and burning iching and burning stanky and fishy stanky and fishy
0	it will help to stop the depletion of our fish
3	if we over fish the fish we eat sone theree will be no fish to eat and we cant just sendthings in from fiji because of the toxin
0	we need totake care of the world we live in. not only land but sea too. by only buying sustainable fish we will do so
0	this  would make people think more carefully about what they eat. the way that fish is currently sold is unsustainable
0	its the right thing to do.
2	who gives a ##### n ####
1	fisheries in NZ should be managed at MEY instead of MSY. managing at MSY  leaves too much room for fisheries to collapse becuase there is not enough money put into stock assessments.
0	because even though it might save the supermarkets money but it will cost our planet.
0	because we should look after commercial fisheries
4	fish has high levels of mercury. it will kill u. we will have no more sea life in the ocean by 2050 the way we are goiing.
4	it shouldnt be more expensive to get the best quality healthy food yozza. unhealthy food is what should be ezpensive. for veryonetobe healthy. i hate fish aswell.
0	cause im having a  fun day
1	Even though  i personally hate seafood. fish caught without care has a larger ecology effect on the ocean which has an effect o all of us. its time to back sustainble practise in all markets and make it the new normal
0	it will protect the oceans ecology
0	it will be  good for the ocean.
0	it would mean our marine lifewould survive
4	how dare you fish deserve to die
0	c  oz im happy to be aive winky face kms
0	###### should be a fish #####
0	beause nigga faggot corn bruh are a rare spiders
0	we need to ensure fish go not extinct.
1	it would be better because we would have fish for futrue kiwis
0	we need to think about future generations
1	fishing leaves rubbish in the ocean
0	because the sea needs fish yo
2	we should take care of our sea
3	POVERTY INCREASE..YOU MEAN ONLY RICH GET TO EAT FISH?
1	Because itwouldreducehe amount of fish bought what would reduce the  amountof fish produced what would be sustainable
1	i feel hopeful because some species of fishe are in danger therefore sustainable fishing help avoiding this
4	I THINK SUPERMARKETS SHOULD STOP MAKING PLASTIC BAGS
1	because then we can work on getting fish back from near extinction
0	we only have one shot at living on this planet. why not cohabit sustainably to protect what we have but also help feed our people. treat all produce with respect and dont overeat/  waste anything
1	because i think it wil help to work towards a mre healthy earth
1	because i believe the good of sustainable fishing outweighs the importance of cost. the planet is something we cant buy again and so working to preserve its resources is the top priority.
0	we should preserve all fidh and make sure they have a stable enviroment bfore we fish them
1	It is important for species of fish to be able to maintain healthy and sustainable population numbers in order for us to continue to consume fish into the future. I do question how companies will be monitored to ensure they are fishing sustainably but this would be a good step into the future.
1	Fish stocks are declining rapidly and we need to consume at a sustainable level so that future generations can enjoy them
1	we need to start making changes  .  Nice if supermarkets offered the options for consumers
4	it is scientifically proven that there is no such thing as sustainable fishing. Fishing is the leading cause of plasic pollution in the sea and causes issues like slave labour and ocean dead zones.
1	It will benefit us in the long term
1	because i think that is a really good idea and something we should be doing but i can only hope we will do things like this and take better care of creation
1	its gonna be difficult to convince everyone to but we are called to take care of the home God has given us
1	we need to preserve species for food stocks
1	it would be good for our ocean
0	its a great initiative for a company to show that they are taking thier social responsibility seriuosly ratger than shifting the blame to consumers
0	because i have my cousins in wellington
2	bceause it is not that fun and it will give me a head achon . but I love very think. But this. THANK YOU for yur time and i hope your have a fun day. byeeee
1	NZ government should only allow fish to be caught sustainably. Bottom trawling is an abomination which should be outlawed immediately.
0	we shouldhelp overfshibg so nz can be a awesome an
3	because we shold love our fish more
1	because we need more fish in the ocean
0	because fishis important part of healthy diet but i want to support the fish in the ocean also
0	I think its too much and the fish have to recover
1	because       it is not fair how when they get born for a while then they just get choppeof
0	We need to make sustainability a priority and set a phenomenal example for the rest of the world!
1	i would ay  bit more forsustainably caughy fish
1	if we dont it wont exist
1	I am hopfull that this will happen but I am unsure that super markets will take the enviroment before money
1	it is the only way.. We all need to think differently about food.
1	There needs to be cameras on every boat to ensure compliance
0	we cant continue to rape the ocean consrantly just toeat fish
3	super markets shouldnt sell fish full stop.
1	You must first define sustainability and then ensure that fish is tracked from "bait to plate". If we want fish for the future it will take all of us. That means being a conscious and informed consumer; having responsive markets; and having strong regulations.
1	The tools to track sustainably caught fish is available.  We need the social and political will to implement.
1	The public has the power to influence through the consumer choices we make. CHOOSE WISELY.
1	its the best for our environment
1	that more is being done to protect sealife
4	because  we are living close to the sea should be chaper
4	There is no such thing as sustainable fishing. That is what companies tell you so they can make profit from poor practice.
0	sustainability is more important than profit
1	Because fishing unsustainably will further damageour ecosystem. being reliant on unsustainability is not a valid way for future generations.
0	i think we are an island nation who shoud use the resourses thatwe have at our despence more responsibly and sustainably so we can rely less on imports.
0	i think this a great idea because not only are there going to be more fish in the sea but also they wont become EXCINT like our native birds are NOW.
0	we need to protect our world
0	so we know whats in our food. Also for the species to continue
0	I hink it will encourage more sustainable fishngmeasures.
1	better for the future of nz
1	because we need to think of the future
4	the problem is more than just fishes. supermarket are the problem
3	I Dont think we can spend our way out of this problem
0	because we are preserving our history for our future genertions to use
1	we need to put the planet first
0	I think the short term price is worth the long term rewards. Healthy oceans and thus healthy people.
0	we should pay more for sustainabe fish
0	we should pay a fair price; otherwise we wont have fishleft later
1	i think its reallly important for the survival of our planet/species but not confident that it will happen
1	Selling dead fish in supermarkets who were raised more sustainably is better for the environment and it feels like a stepping stone towards not having dead animals for sale at all
3	there may not even be fishes by 2050  so why even sell in the first place?
3	because if we dont do something  our native fishstocks will not be sustainable
4	all fish could be lost by 2050. FISH CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLY CAUGHT. there are so many othr sustainable and ethical fish alternatives
1	that it should be done but can become expensive for people and families with less
0	Its not good to overfish and we need to be responsible
1	due to the increasing importance of conservation of marine life.
0	fish are dying stop killing them
0	because we are ##### otherwise /(-.-)/
1	we are becoming more awhere of the need to preserve our fish supplies and protect them  for future generations.
0	use code ##### in the fortnite item shop
1	because we shouldnt over fish ournatural supplies
0	i think that they should be selling fresh fish from the sea and not fish that have been there for a very long time
3	I am a bitworried cause the fish might have family and i dont think that we should have fish that has bin caught for over 3days
4	i am scared because what if the fishes have fanilys
1	keep fishes alive for future generations
1	We all have to cut back on our voracious appetites for plundering natural resources We are going to destroy our childrens heritage.
0	fish are also just living beings. they should livea healthy life and not be poisoined to be food for humans.
3	mo te o te ika te take heoi mo ng tamariki  tangaroa he take ano tera kia tiaki taiao
1	This doesn't mean we can't have certain fish just less quantity of said endangered fish
3	FOOD SAFETY IS A KEY TO FOOD HYGEINE
1	we dont inheritthe wrld from our parents. we borrowed it from ourchildren.
3	we are already pasta point of reversibledamage
1	no oneseems to care enough take action
0	Because history will repeat itself. If we do not use only sustainable resources there will be few resourses left. The native fish will go extinct then we will end up moving on to other species and animals.
0	only sustainable meat should be used
0	so that they are only capturing the fish they NEED not too many
0	I  THINK WE NEED TO  PRESEVE WHAT WE HAVE ....
4	TAKING TO LONG TO PUT THINGS IN PLACE
1	we must protect our marine life
4	Should people rather starve than be fed what is not considered sustainable n YOUR opinion?
2	it wuld be  good but ultimately dont care
3	this will afect more of poor population than rich

0	im excited because im going to ##### in a week
4	because #### wont go out with me
4	because i think weshould trust the fisherman
0	shows we are starting to think about the consequences of extraction
0	because fish are an excellent resource and they could  be expensive or cheap!!!!
1	i think this a great idea but worry profit and greed will keep all from compling
1	it i better fr the envionment
1	that would be ideal but i believe conpanys are too greedy to make it happen
0	so we have them in the future
0	it will be more sustainable for everyone
1	young people are more aware of the earth limits and our impact
1	because it should give a chace for strugging populations to bunce back.
0	sustainability is super important in keeping resourses alive so future generations can continue to use what we have. even at a higher price
1	i have neverreally thought about it until you asked. i hope that all meats we eat are organic and fresh x
1	being able to sustain our environment is our responsibility alone
3	we people are with too many
1	fishing needto be controlled tomaintsin fisheries forfuture use. if nz fisheries must comply withsustaiable quotas so should its imports
0	animals shouldnt be killed for money
1	would be good if everytig was sstanable
0	supermarkets only care about profitas a busiess
1	over the years fish are decreasing
0	there are not enough marine resources to sustain our level of fisheries
0	thats how things should e done
0	pop off sis!!! save the oceans and eat less meat
1	we still need fish to eat but  we need to keep ballance .
1	we should save our planet. could cut cost with less packaging?
1	we build a future thats worth more than money when we prioritise rangi and pp. He ng tngata te ptiki o te whnau! Our ancestors lived in harmony with the earth forhudreds of years so lets return ora te taiao
1	coz i want to preserve the ocean for other generations
0	at the rate of declining resources humans need to become more resourceful and adopt a whole foods lifestyle. increasing the cost of fish would only help this transition...
1	Our ocean - like our land - is a finite resource and we need to start taking care of it so it can take care of us. Our disrespect of our earth will only harm us in the long run.
2	blabla bla fish is fish justeatit
0	fish is bad not to eat the fed snapper from pacinsav
3	People dont have enough to eat affordibly. They are forced to poach.
0	Kei pau k? t?nei kai heikai m ku uri
0	help the fish be aound for longer
3	i agree but i wouldnt be able to afford it.
1	i hope that one day the earth and its propertys will be fully stanbel but being a kid its up to the grown ups for now
0	because its the best sustainable option
0	this is the only way  to protect our food sources
1	I think this is a great idea for our environment
1	because some people do care about the food they eat.
0	humans go throughso much food and resources and it is time we begin to be more conscious about where these products are from in order to benefit our planet
0	its good for the oceans sustainablity
4	becas theb i drop all ny food vr the driveway
4	because we shouldnt be investing in our fiish more we should nuture them to have an large amount so it will benefit us for te forseeable future so we can sell them in stores
4	its waste of time because who cares aboutfish?? they dont have brains or feelings
0	fish are dying out. try not eating them
0	we need to acept the real price of food
1	It could allow large scale change and lead to more sustainable food systems - would require minimal individual effort
0	if not there will be no fish left to catch
1	because it will eventuly distroy the hole planet if you care or not.
0	this is important for our ocean
0	itis a great way also to bring humans back to see how dependant we are on the nature
0	me tiaki matou i te moana we must ook afterthe sea
0	we need to protect our fish
1	i really want to go gokarting soon buti stilll really like tepaa its very  its very interestingm
0	i look forward to seeing us prepared to pay the actual cost to protect our 'at risk' species instead of only talking about caring.
0	we cant keep depleting the ocean at this rate. we MUST change our practices
1	cause then maybeor oceans ecosystems wouldnt collapse in on hemseles in thirty years time and ill be able tooneday retire by the seaside
2	it is a start. but exports probably use more and offshre fishing
0	then we have enough fish and sufficent dversity for futurre generations
0	IFwe wantto be able to eat fish for years to come we need to presrve the species and not overfish or consume
1	we should be much more aware of the condition of the oceans and the fish are  sentient  .
0	Because its better not taking them out of there home. Its great!
1	its th right thng to do
0	so that means there will be no fish ban
4	we shouldnt be eating fish at all
4	"Sustainability" is a misrepresentation of the issue. Greenwashing the mass slaughter of ocean life is a cop out response. Industrial society is the problem and managing fish stocks can't help in the long term to deal with the issues facing us.
0	because we will loose species otherwise.
1	because if you kill all the fish then there is no more left
1	fighting against climate change and acting ethically and environmentally
0	as populations grow. sustanability becomes crucial
3	Not everyone can afford it. We need to ensre kids have healthy meals first.
4	im excited thatim going to austailia tommorrow my nme is called no one

0	i think we need tolook after our taonga and resources
1	for the future of genertions ahead
1	because it would go some way to prove we as a species are not completely selfish. we need to change our habits immediately to preserve what is left of this earth.
4	all our supermarkets should only stock sustainable catch
3	this makes me sad.i am #
3	i think that there will be a tsunami oneday and i am scaredthat my family will you know i cant say it it really hrts my feelings
0	FOR MY ###### BECUSE SHE IS GOING TO ######### TOMORROW
1	its important to protect the future of our planet AND the fishing industry to fish sustainably.
1	we should look after our oceans
0	its better to have sustainablycaught fish because in thefuture we will have none left if we dont take careof our fish
1	more study is needed to ensure that each species is indeed sustainable
0	we are at a crossroads ..a tipping point. we know better so should do better. the time to act is now
1	ths isa positive step as long as we have clear ubderstanding and consenss about what sustainility means
0	Cost is relative. As humanity moves towards the noosphere we should be aware that what is cheap to us is usually expensive for our habitat and other people further away.
0	ensuring fish is sustainable will mean fish for the future
0	it mean that it will be great for our earth
0	because diversity is needed for us to survive and maintain our way of life.
0	the fishese should also have life in the ocean
1	I  think that we'll  be ok if we doit
1	i like idea and fishese could have  happy
4	that is a ###### ###### thing to do and i feel inclined to say stuff to stop it happening
0	other wiise we will run out
0	otherwise it will tip the balance and cause horrible effects for all other life.
0	because save the planizzle ma nizzle
0	its  unfair ifthey dont catch sustainably caught fish
1	we have no choice if we want sustainablefi sh supplies
0	species should not be dying out because of us
4	Coming from a country that outsources many products... this should already be a thing. Why are we only suggesting this when it used to be the case in the past?
2	that the people will end up killing theworld anyway
1	it makes sense to so there is more sealife
0	do it for a better future
1	i thinked if the set up more farms for fish to encourage less fish caught externally that would be great
0	Would definitely pay more for fish sustainably caught.
1	Only hopeful because its only and idea and not likely reality. The method    of industrial fishing is also a major concern with fish being caught indescriminately.
0	because ifitissustainably caught it will be availble to later  generations preservation iskey
1	we need to take care of whar is left in nature
0	fish stocks in the ocean are in crisis
1	it will help us to think; realise we are connected to all of this; and hopefully act differently.
0	they shouldnt sell any fish.but sustainable fish is a good start.
1	this is good because it will preserve our fish
0	leave more fish for the future
4	We no longer need to eat animal.
0	as they likely supply the majority of consumers; in order to continue the supply the only way forwards is to encourage sustainable fishing for the current and future generations. that would also encourage native fish repopulation and limit introduced pest species.
0	i think you sood care for the land and the ocean  sea more.
1	that is very difficut to monitor. would lve to see it but unsure how posible it is
0	because few people maintain an up to date knowledge of fish catch sustainability but just want a bit of choice. many people assume fish that's for sale IS sustainable.
3	i think fish should caught in  a sustainable way
0	looking after our environment is important for the sake of our childreb
0	God told us to look after His eart
0	it contributes to conserving our wildlife
1	its good that they  sell good fish but the only bad thing is that it costs more xx
0	It wouldmean that we don't runout of fish which I think is better than just catching fish to sell
4	i am angry because it hurts them
1	donot want to see species to become extinct
0	Because itis bletter for the fishes.
1	im currently working in the seafood dept. at new world in chch and as far as im aware all our fish is sustainably caught in NZ
1	it will help the underwater ecosystem thrive once more and maybe we could have some native NZ fish repopulate also this might decrease the number of dolphins and penguins stuck in fishingnets
0	for very fish sold we need to ensure two are born and grow to full age..  breeding stocks need to be protected
1	because i care about the wourld
0	we should always consume only what the planet can afford
0	even cheap expensive or medium it is bad for us and the enviorment
3	won t be any left soon
1	i thinklife is great because kaya is in it
0	stop trawling on the ocean floor
1	we need tobe mreporacive in chang and be less cncened abut money
3	i want my children to be able to go fishing like i have. this cant happen if there is none left....
0	then i can eat fish in the future
0	its the only way to protect the fish reserves for future
1	ethical andallows us to preserve our environmet
1	cos i want there to be fishies in the sea in thefuture
0	Our fish stocks are dying. If we don't protect them there won't be any fish left.
1	in  2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish
1	its important they are inflencing consmers to make the right decision
0	i like my world t be full of variety rather than jellyfish
0	People shouldbe free and be good
1	Everyone should be kind to each other
3	Show their feelings and find out
0	Otherwise we won't have ANY fish
0	we need to protect te taonga o moana
2	not all that worriedaslong as its on my plate
4	they lie!!!!!!!! IT IS NOTHIG BUT A MARKETING TRICK
0	GO VEGAN but sustainably caught fish are  better than unsustainably caught ones
4	you didbt hav thexhoxolate milk i wabted
1	bc environment good! capitalism bad _ #### #
0	i wish we all understand that climate change is real. i think its too late to change now. but we can still try i hope
1	sustainable is not a clearly defined word and the data on fish stocks is not veryaccurate. between avdertisement/ marketing and vested interest i dont think we will be quick on this one. we always push the limits never play it conservative with spieces and resources
1	Efforts being made and taking initiative is essential.
0	that the all blacks will win  evry game
0	because choir is today and we are missing school.:)
1	In dobbg this itenables marine lif to grow.
0	if we want to survive life can't be about money.
0	We as a human race need to take better care of our planet
0	It will mean the fish are loked after and prevent them from overfishing
1	to have a thoughtful world we can gain a connected mind.
1	we can only hope that greed does not interfere with this decision
1	it would be a good choice fora substainable future
0	we needto start having such korero and indeed we are
1	thatitwould be good for the ebviroment but i dobt thibk it wil happen because there  are selfish people in th world
1	i thibk that fresh fish is yum
2	well some people like it how   it  is
1	that this is a great idaier
1	itsa good idea but i dot really care about it.
0	itsa good becausei justdo ya know
2	cause then the people will have to pay more     yyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeetttttttttttt          use code fresh or lazar
0	becaus ###### is bettr than #### abd ####
4	jhggjthhjhghhgcxhfgxdghfnrhjaejedwfsfgahehhrte i knowsomeone how likes lola
0	that all fish should be caught sustainably
0	the future must be improved fo us tosurvive
1	It is good to regulate the fishing rates to prevent overfishing.
0	this will prevent overfishing because people will think about wether they want to pay this much for fish oreither skip it
0	we need fish in our oceans
2	cost of product will determine purchase

4	we should'nt do that its not ok.
3	i dont really know good bye
1	as we have a goverment that sounds like they want to help. but will they ACTUALLY do something.
0	would mean higher quality so better fish and chips not only in wellington
0	because its cool to explore things you havent known before since back then
0	with the outlook on our enviroment we need to take every opportunity to help get back on track and prolong the affects ofglobal warming
0	because we should take more responsibility for our actions
0	there wont be any fish left
1	itll help set the standard for providing sustainable food
0	we need to cnserve the fishes
3	im so sad about the fishs
0	This planet with all its creatures is the only home we have got and it is our duty to protect our home in any way possible.
1	i think protecting nature is more imortent than our personnal comfort
1	it would help econonomy and stop fishfrom dissapearing from the wild
0	i am excited   that i am going on tv
3	i think there is going to be an earthquak
4	they shound stop caching fish peopel can achley throup if you eat to mach
1	because it helps more fish survive
4	that im not sure about that but iam angry about it
2	i dont want to offend anyone but personally i dont rlly care
0	we need to reconsidered the predaction overthe planet. to keep the hunanity we need to control the resources and to slow the comsumtion ofthe resorce
0	there  is hope in everything that is possible
1	i think the world is cool
1	there has to always be hope
0	excited for the futureand everything nature has to bring
1	i think the world is potive
1	I think this is a great idea and actually needs to happen
4	i think ########  ####### is awesome
0	to be as nature intended through selection it would be nice to have meats sometimes. i am vegetarian because the carbon footprint of each of us is too great.
0	fish that are produced unsustainable should not be given a market
1	Because that would mean that there would be fish for the future
0	we have the motivation and science reasearch to implement these regulations. we no longer have to sit back and we wont lookpast it
3	there will be no more fish
0	i like this place best trip ever
1	i think because not so many fish get killed.
0	we need to make sure their will be fish for future generations.
1	it would be great but we also need to make sure less privileged families can still afford good kai. maybe so subsidies in those cases
0	we all have a responsibiity to live sustainably so those after us have the same or better lives
0	i thik it's because the museum is telling me cool fact
1	FOR THE FUTURE GENERATION TO ENJOY  A BALANCE  ECOSYSTEM
3	just dont eat fish. Its pretty obvious
1	to maintain the ecosystem for future generation
0	better enviroment and for the future generation
0	nz should be carbon positive. not just carbon neutral.
0	i think every product should be social economoical and ecological sustainable. that means it is still there for futur generations and is not harming the environment.
0	overfishing is a big problem! so sustainable caught fish is a better solution for the problems which are caused by overfishing.
0	because we are the causeof plastic ib te ocean so why   not    :))))))trysave the plnet
1	becuase it would be bettter for you
1	B?c®s? ®r s?s r? nt ngh f®sh t d th? ny mr? nd ®r ch?ns r? sp?chl w? n??d t r?sp?ct th? w®ld l®f?
3	people are greedy and only consider the nw
1	we have to take action now
0	because our seas are very much polluted that by looking carefully at the seafood we eat we look after our selves and sea creatures
0	people buy what is avilable. ifonlysustainablethings  are available the that is whattheyll buy
0	but bulk fish havesting techniques like trawling are highly destructive to the fragile benthic environment and are largely indiscriminate in catch species. for every bin of for example gurnard commercially trawled there are 3 bins of discards . how can we go on like that? manycatch species havent had a stock assessment since theywentintotheqms. how can you 'sustainably' manage a taonga you know little about? take trevally for example exported for a fraction over $2/kg ooooh it makes me mad. but why doesnt it change? well for example the president of the national partybis alsoa directorof 2 of nzs largest seafood companies. the science of fish is fully captured by industry. a propertyright was conferred in 1986 with the qms and the system is BROKEN.
0	because imin a good moodand because it cool
0	because we have dancesplash at micheal fowler center 19/9/10
1	we needto do all we can to protect our precious ikaand moana
1	fish souldbe fresh so peopledont get sick

1	Because I don't want the fish to die
2	beause i don't care as long asit taste good i won't care
0	we need to do this if we want to survive
1	industry is the cancer of this planet
0	we should be more mindful of where our kai is coming from.
3	because theremightnot be any fish left
0	we need to put the environment not our stomachs first
1	we should be thinking of future people
1	bc we are actualtalking about it
1	money might stop it. greedy for profits?
0	we need to stop destroying everything
0	we need to take better care of our oceans
0	because I an in wellington with uncle sam and ruth
1	to make a better future for our children
1	better controls through this whole food system from catching sustainably to selliing
0	sustainabilty is one way to go
1	i think it would just raise fish health standards so i hope it works. k p® nz
0	BECAUSE I THINKTHAT PEOPLE SHOULD CARE MORE ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT
1	it could change our world a little bit. one small step is better then no one
0	people should only eat land animals
1	that is a good idea so we dont disrupt the natural environment
1	In my opinion they shouldn't sell fish at all but it's better than the current situation.
0	Because then we know that we are eating food that is good for us! But maybe dont put the costs up to much cos some people might not be able to pay for REALLY  expencive. S g?t fr?sh food to stay safer!
1	because our oceans are the most inportant habitat on our planet
3	i am worried because itisbad catchibg unsustainable fish.
0	NO TE NEA E RATA ANA AHAU KI ENEI MOMO KIRIATA
0	NO TE MEA HE TINI HANGA KORERO TENEI KI AHAU NO E MEA E RATA ANA AHAU KI ENEI MOMO KIRIATA
0	it starts with our supermarkets making the change to change consumers behaviours. its a must
0	I think this is a great idea because we need to be more environmentaly consious
3	supermarkets are not places to sell fish
0	it means that they are starting o think about the environment and future generations
0	No fish should be soldfor huma consumption at all howevr this is a good step
0	i believe we sould do ou part any way we can
0	our seas are a important resourse. over fishing is not for the interest of the future
0	fish are not an unlimted resource
1	It is the only way forward
0	Big businesses support is essential for spreading sustainable practices to that sector of the population that might not be sustainability literate..... but surely go to the supermarket!
2	i dont buy fish from the supermarket.
1	I think that the fish we get from the supermarket should be caught in a nice way
0	FISH IS YUMMY AND A GOOD SOURSE OF FOOD  SO THE FISHERMEN SHOULD GETA REASONABLE PRIZE FORTHEIR WELLCAUGHT FISH
0	its the only way to save the world. our habits should be change.
0	I think that inproving the enviroment is way more inportant then a simple problem of costly fish.
1	i think its inprtant to protect our world
0	we cant replace these species once they are gone
1	KIA NOHO MAURI TONU NGA TUAKANA
0	It will help keep the spply plentiful
1	the environment is mre important than our bank account
2	because i dont mind about enything
1	I agee with this idea because cauching fesh and clear fish helps the healty of a human but to make it real we have to let the oceans sea lakes and rivers clear without puttin plastic or any tipes of rubbish on them
0	if unsustained fishing is allowed it would drain future fishing qoutas down
0	save the environment and all living organisms
1	I think it's a new improvment!
0	We are not being sustainable in our practices
4	only the rich and wealthy will be able to purchase fish and that's not fair
0	to maintain ecosystems for future enerations. you take out oneand nt long before we as humans go down the samepath
4	we are smart  we can manage our resources
4	FISH ARE EVIL. We should kill them all first.
2	USING COST BASED RESTRICTIONS PERPETUATES SOCIAL INEQUITIES. REDUCING THE AVAILABILITY OF FISH WILLPRICE LOW INCOME PEOPLE OUT
2	i think that weshould do it for the kids in africa. they dont have as well education
1	i thing it shoued be sold ifneed dud
0	because it will help the sea
1	i think its a good idea to be vegetarian to preserve fish stocks
1	i think that  we should be hopeful becausewe havenoulths and when we see people doing it weask them why and prove are point
0	because we like fish and the planet
0	we are overhuntng our food and killing our planet
0	we need to protect our environment for future generations
1	because we are overfishing and it is harming our ecosystem. fish does not take long to regenerate so this will really help
2	you arereally annoyibg abd you suck
1	this help to protect marine creature
1	i think its good so fish dont die as quickly as they wuld of
4	too many snakes in the apple casserole
0	ka tino koa ahau mena ka hokona atu nga toa hokomaha i nga ika toitu anake no te mea he 99 paiheneti o a tatou kai kua whakauru etahi rawa tukino mo a tatou tinana. ka tika me whakahoki mai i nga kai hauora
3	i think that continuing to eat fish even if sustainable wont be enough to fix the problem. there either needs to be a bigger move away from seafood in our diets or to better regulate or police the industry.
4	we should stop  supporting  the meat industry altogether. none of it is sustainable
4	should not eat meat af all
0	I think that this intiative will significantly help the ecosystem.
1	if supermarkets sell more sustainable seafood then itsaves the ecosystems andit is more humane and sustainble for th fish
0	I belive that this new initiative will profoudly impact the ecosystem positively!
1	Should we all make a conscious move to try to live more environmentally and sustainable a big change will occur. It doesn't take a few peopledoig tings perfectly. It takes many people doing things imperfectly.
1	Because this will help the local fish population.
1	because fish shoud not be over hunted
0	so theres more fish and we might not eat all of it.
0	we should not kill fish we dont eat
0	i am haveinga rely good time here today
0	i lovvethis place but ##### wont lisan
1	itswould be better and helppeoples health
0	should we be eating fish in te first place?
2	better fish is good and i'm ok with the fish now.
1	better to eat no fish vegan future
1	it would be great for the regeneration of fish populations and all the bycatch but the increase in price would further limit people in povertys access to healthy food
0	because id liketoknw iam eatibg sustainable food when i buy it
0	this will place a good impact on the world
1	we should save our fish and seas
3	john cena ate too much abd he died   here  o de fyx
3	i think fish should have a free time just like us
0	Unsustainable fishing now means NO fishing in the near future
0	sounds awesome. suermarkets wouldnt be happy to let go of theirprofits though
1	so theres more for the future
2	i dont i am a kid
1	because the freemarket has the power to change outcomes if we make it
1	i am hopeful because i have a family
1	shows that people are thinking of something not themselves
1	id happily pay more for produce if itwas sustainable. Food packaging needs to be clearer. How about we introduce laws that ensure Supermarkets have special areas in the store that clearly label all produce from sustainable sources?
0	to help our planet we will have to forego cheaper items on the shelves etc. for too long we have had everything cheap and mass produced. its costing us our earth
1	I think that it would be better to sacrifice some money for fish to be fished sustainably.
3	then apart from fish we would have no meat to eat unless we start a farm orselves.
0	i want to have our kai be available for myfuture grandchildren
0	this will help proseve our fish for thefuture and add more vaule to our produce that is so important
0	this will help the fish because fishing loads of fish each day will make them extinct
0	we need fish for our future generations
1	because then there will be more fish in the ocaen
0	IT GIVES WTER DWELLING KAI A CHANCE TO REPOPULATE SO THAT HOPEFULLY THE WORLDS KAIMOANA LEVELS ARE SUSTAINA
0	farming native fish and shellfish can provide sustainable food for us without depleting wild stocks
1	We nee to sustain our fish and since we are the cause of the trouble the are in we need to pay the price
1	N te mea te moana he pounamu m ng tngata katoa
0	I  thinh that every fish should have a life
0	Great idea! We have to protect nature so it will protect us!
1	because we will have more native fish
1	that we need the earth to be a better place so thatwe can have a long healthy life
0	the  ocean is our life force. we should protect &work along side it not exploit it
0	we all must take resposibilityfor the future we leave behind
0	I think it is a bit weird
0	it shiuldntbea question if it means saving and protecting our eco system
1	fish taste better when not stressed as they die
1	will be far better for fish population
1	Less buy catch and if it could be to demand that would be great. Locally caught fish as well only sold
1	I think it is good because is helps the enviroment.
1	im hopeful because this isnt an option but it is necessary.
1	depends on effectiveness of regulation and enforcement
0	cos the fish will go extinct otherwise... seems like a no-brainer...
1	it would be amazing but will only happen when it becomes moreprofitable to do so. As a species we stink atmaking longterm ethical decisionsat short term cost
4	we need to protect our marine animals
0	I think we have to start caring about where our food comes from and pay attention to problems like mass production and oer fishing
1	it might not be enough food!
3	it would be bad for the enviromentand everyone would wipe the population of fish
4	###### is cool and ###### and me
1	its the best option forour planet
0	to ensure my grandchildren will be able to eat the same fish i do now
0	because the popluation is growing and if we continue to fish unsustainably then the numbers of fish will decrease as a nation we must do better for the future
1	no such thing as sustainable fishing. Just STOP FISHING. Leave the ocean and fish alone. Lab grown and clean meat seafood or plantbased is the future and the only way to feed a growing population sustainably.
2	go vegan leave fish in the ocean
1	i think it would be amazing but to hard to keep up
0	our future depends on this happening
1	there  are nouugh peole of the next generation who are smart enough to figure out how to reverse our current poblrms.
0	bycatch of endagered species is too common. Also diseases sread from fish farms are  killing wild populaiotions especially salmon
0	save our many species.  Support our local fishermen like the guy on country calendar catching crays and butterfish with his crewmwn and mate. They rsally cared about their small trade and local area.
1	I think that there should be... i don't know you ask someone else.
2	It really doesn'tmatter really i justlike fish like most people... so yeah :P
1	because we should only  buying what is best for us
1	we should happily pay more for environmentally friendly food sources
1	itseem to be catching on lotsof peopledoing it
1	we shouldbe more careful.  humans are cognisant of the damage we are doing
0	i thibk it shouldnt be the consumers responsibility
1	because there are less and less fishes in our seas
1	its hard knowing some of our favourite fish to eat are unsustainble but once they're gone they're gone forever. we need to make a change
0	hope to be on this earth for a while yet
1	we should all do something to help
0	i think that the contamination and imbalance generated due commercial fishing is huge.
0	we need to keep our environnement liveable
1	sustaiinaility is a key for maintaining biodiversity and natural heritage for future generations. there should also be limits on expts
0	we need to lookafter our fishary
0	we shouldnt sell or eat fish into extinction.
0	The world is more important then the money
0	me tiaki ttou i te taiao
1	economics is adaptable extinction is not
1	it would help sustain our oceans without damaging our economy
0	Important to protect Tangaroa. Dont let human greed damage Papat®nuku any more or it will be too late. Do it for our mokopuna.
1	support for a long lasting sustainable world
1	i have hope for the future generations. i think they are smarter and have mre common sense then to kill the planet :)
0	BC AD I OPP SAVE THE TURTLS
0	because the fish will never run out and none other fish species is going to go extincted
1	because this is an importantthingthatneeds to happen
1	values based approach vs economic based approach. Certainy a Maori approach is beneficial also. Tiakina te taiao.
0	we need to protect ika from extincion
1	as long as its not wrapped     in plastic
1	Honestly we shouldn't be eating fish anyway due to the rate of micro plastics circling around the oceans currents
1	it would save if not stop over fishing of tangaroa
0	because this is not a respectful way to live
3	there doesnt seem to be enough attention on this problem and it is pretty difficult to find ecological caught fish...
0	this would be wonderful knowing our local supermaket wasdoing their bit to supportour planetwould encourage me to supporttgem
0	We need to protect the environment :*
1	it is important to ensure the wellfare f the fish whilst also making surethatfood supply is affordable and in abundance
0	i think it is a no brainer.
3	i like to eat all types of fish
1	where theres hope there is always a chance
0	otherwise there will be no more of that type offish
0	Because it is nt good when the fish are fshed out of a se
0	I think this is great. We need to make sure that the fish populations can thrive again.
1	because its higher priced butmeans it is better for our ocean creatures so im hopful it will work out
1	i fing dat is a great  idea aye
1	it may be hard to enforce
0	We all work  as one - without balance we are none
1	i thibk that having awell balance eco system willbe profitable
1	I think this is a good way to keep all the environmental and natural balances in place.
1	fish in supernarkersis too old and expensice so dnt buy it
0	it is so important and should be law
1	becauseit will be hard to monitor and regulatethis activity and there needs to be clearer more transparent means of monitoring the way this activity is carried out
1	i think that change must come from businesses. Our power to change the world must come from companies that make profit exploiting it. We as individuals can drive systemic change that puts planet before profit
1	because you see ads on tv saying that they have responisbly sourced fish and it not always is
3	it might not be sourced properly and people ould get sick how can we trust supermarkets and seafood sales
2	because i love fish and i dont relly care
0	we only have one fucking chance at this
1	i think this because... it  saves the speciesof ish for the next genortoin
4	also because its expensive to the companies catc  hng the fish and they wont have many costumers
4	i think that if we catch fish that are over populated and less expensive it would be easier to bie and sell
1	we should care better fr our planet

1	sustanable choices are a necessity but i dont think everyone is on board or able to afford sustainable choices
1	because  supermarkets are the main places where human catch their food.  so if the fishis sustainable the humans will be. In the other case.....
0	i think the sea will be a better place forfish to live
0	because we need to preserve our ecosystems
1	we should keep the balance as much as possible
1	because if they dothat here is less ned for those who ctch fish illegally

1	I think that the fish caught should come from a sustainable source and that a variety of sizes of fish will be caught or else big fish genes will become rarer due to the overfishing of only big fish.
0	so there's more for  other people.

4	because there will be less fish in the shops
1	that is a good idea and i am hopeful that is what will happen in the future
1	It could go  either way considering expenses so it's not a fantastic idea.
0	Because it would save more species of fish allowing people to eat fish for longer.
0	I think that it would  be a good idea  because  it is more substanable and can help save species of fish
1	Fish is only one food source. The issue is pollution. We ought to stop making plastics altoghther and resort to 100 percent recycling of the plastice already made.
1	yes becau there will be more fish in the ocean.
1	In an octupuses garden in the shade.
0	we all need to take responsibility for the health of our oceans and this includes corporates showing leadership
0	i think that   saving more fish in the ocean will help save sealife and if there is hardly any more left our ocean would not be very exciting.
0	Its good to keep them aliveso we will alays have a sustainable amount of fish
0	because there is heaps of that fish
0	Because destruction to oceans and wildlife for industry profit has to stop. Come on NZ
0	because it could save some fish
3	it  could  get  old.and  we could  get  sick
0	sustainability fo the future is about  controlling our ocean stocks
1	is get really a lower cost or normal higher cost in the future
1	i think that its one step forward for a sustainable future we need to start looking out for the fish we seem to only take without thinking or caring. We need to start caring lossing the fish overall is the higher cost
0	i am excited for a normal high price and good people to catch a few fish in the future.
0	I thinck it is a good idea

1	balance  between affordability and cnservation will hopefully swing so that sustainable fishing becomes more economical
1	i think my nm? ®s god
3	i think that if there are no more fish left in our ocean then sharks and other things that eat fish will die.
0	i think that we need to care for our fish and not take all the fish from the sea!
4	they are taking too many fish
3	i  am worried  that people are taking too many fish.
1	I  am hopeful because people are recycling more rubbish
1	i think not only will the fishtaste better. it wil be better for the enviroment
0	for the good of our future
1	i think it is  good idea but people still hace a right to chooe what they want.
1	that will still be fish left in the ocean
2	people should stop throwing out rubbish it gets into the sea and sea creatures will die if they eat it or get tangeld in t
3	im worried that  creatures like fish and dolphins will die from plastic.
3	that people should stop thowing rubbish in the water becaus sea cretures will die if they eat it  or if they get tangeld in it
1	By promoting fishthat is sustainably caught it could nt oly protect our environment but it could help stop the destrction of the fishing industry as well
0	because i want to have yummy fish all of my life and the life of my chilfren and their children and everyone in the world
1	i personally dont like eating fish but i think it shouldbe sustainably caught so everyone can enjoy with less impact to the environment
3	How do we know that they're not lying?!
1	i didnt realise they werent. will make sure only buy sustainable fish from now.
0	i can play with my mum and dad
0	#### and I are going to the North Pole!
1	i hope that this one day happens
4	cause they should jus leave the damn fish alone
0	its a better way off life living of the land and sea..
1	it is the right way of doing it
1	so that there will always be fishies.
1	because it isbetter for the environment.
1	i think they should do it because it mean weget more fish
1	It would go a long way to protecting the ecology of our waterways which is so imortant.
1	I think protecting our nature and looking at different ways to ensure a healthy planet gives me hope for the generations to come!
1	I think there is no easy or simple solution to this and the economy also need to survive somehow BUT we really don't have choice. Do we?
1	I  HOPE THIS HAPPENS FOR A BETTER FUTURE
3	CAN WE STOP THINKING ONLY ABOUT MONEY AND START THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS PLANET
2	i think im very angry fir some reason and idont now why im doing this because thsis so boring
1	so we have fish in the fute
2	because we need to balance what we take frm the moana
1	influencing buyers with responsible behaviours by increasing awareness between human and ecosystem
1	Overfishing is a problem that needs to be avoided to increase sustainability butthere are much larger problmd that need to be focused on.
1	I believe that yes this is  a good idea but how will it be monitered etc. We need to be careful as many people may nt care about the environment as we do.
0	yeet this is a good idea.
1	Ok then.  anyway what are  these answers
4	its very silly because people pay more then they should.
1	this is important to sustain supply and keep oceans healthy
0	because God created all living things and we should protect them all. ALSO sustainable fishing will help the rapid decrease in marine life
1	i think that i help he animals i wil be a helpful
1	some fish are caurt in a way that my damage the environment or poisen other life. I'd rather sustainable fish instead of nonsustainable fish.
0	i would keep on buying it over and over again
0	i think this  is a no brainer we dont have a choice and must make changes for the better now.
1	its a good idea andcould help th environmenta lot
0	because fissys are frieds not yummy
0	it is the only way to have healthy seas to last for many years to come.
1	becuse we can protect our sea
1	people keep catching the wrong animals and maybe this idea will help.
1	probaly cause it wont wipe out the popuation of the fish speases
2	i dont care bcause i an reall stupid
4	i am angry coz me no get ice cream(i m an idiot)
1	I think... this cuz... fish... idk (i dont know)
1	i think... this should happen so that notso many fish will b extinct cuz of hoomans! (humans)
1	Although it may cost more this method doesn't put some species of fish into danger of extinction. :D  uwu ;-;  ('o')
4	i think... I ANGRY CUZ 8 PERCENT OF PEOPLE R ANGRY AND I LIKE DIS IDEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	but fish is yummy #### ;-;
2	i dont know what this means
0	cause we will have more fish to eat and have some more family time
1	As fish stocks are becoming depleted need to control the amount  we take
0	im guing to the new time  sone
1	the next generation willlok after our planet
0	because nothing costsmore than healthy seas. healthyseas equals healthylands
1	i think that if supermarkets did not allow unsustainablely sourced fish that it would promote more care and quality within the fishing industry because cheap fish would no longer be a profitable option
1	profit is more important to big compaies than sustainability
2	i do not eat fish cause i do not like it
3	because everyone will waste their money
0	It will help stop overfishing and keep certain species of fish alive and not extinct.
1	World fish stocks are under severe stress due to overfishing and poor management. The ecosystems of the ocean are at tipping point in most regions. It is imperative we make major changes to the way we live and use resources or our children will no longer have access to fresh food and clean water. Our ancestors knew the value of the natural environment. Modern society is rapidly destroying the future.
1	that im hopeful of that the bad animals  got rid of
1	we need to protect our fish
1	we protect fish in new zealand
0	seems good since overfishing is a problem
3	i am worried because if they keep being caught they will become extinct.
0	it will be good for the circle of life.
3	becase they will be extinct soon
1	we also need to stop wrapping fish in plastic.
1	i think the fisheries system is one of the leadibg causes of climate change. but no one really acknowleges it but by doing so we are ignoring the breakdown of the natural food chaie. it is timefora change
1	because we dont wabt to killall thefish
1	because more fish can be her for others
3	becausethere needs to be fish for others
1	if we are sustainable we are ensuring the future offish
0	essential to make the right choice easy
3	how do we know that athe fish sustainabily court fish
1	so i think that we need to be sustainable ok thanks
1	this isa good idea so all futre generations can stilleat fish
1	For the future of  fish and the industry.Sustainability.
1	because the fishies will go extinct
4	cuz i like dem cheap fish
4	thefish are yummy and they will  grow back
1	cuz fish are beutifal bengs that shoudnt go extint
4	PINK FLUFFY UNICORNS also are yummy
0	i think it is a good idea because in thequestion it says sustainable caught fish and we are being unsustainable and so we need to change our ways.So this is a good start.
1	because it is a big problam  and we  should take  care of it. but familys  might not be able to afford it.
0	I think excited is my favourite felling because it means you really love this thing that is coming
0	HI I LOVE FISH. I EAT DOGS
0	because that way the fish wont go extinct as quickly
0	Ethical sourcing of fish is extremely important becuase it displays the way in whih we as people relate to our environment. As humanity we need to care about the way we conduct our processing in the most sustainable manner possibl.e
1	bisnesess are always looking for money and if it costs less for the storethen they will probably do it as opposed tothe harder option.
1	because itis better for the environment even though it is a bit costly
1	because itsmens more food or us and better future for the inviroment
1	so we can have fishn the future
0	we dont want to run out of fissh
3	because it means ethier way we are taking the fish
0	humans are shit kill them all
0	people need to stop being so greedy! we are ruining the world
0	as it will allow fish stocks to recover for future generations
1	it will never happen due to greed. But I still hold out hope.
1	this way the fish population will never go extinct and therefore there will always be a reliable source of food for future generations
1	because its good for the enviroment and it tastes better
4	i did a ### on  a fish  and thenit ate y ####
0	because otherwise we will deplete a very important resource and also disrupt the local ecosystem which could have disastrous consequence
3	ten year motatorium on ALL fishing n Aotearoa.
1	sustainability is vital for preserving our earth. hopeful because progress towards promoting and implementing a more environmentally conscious society is slow.
1	We all need to take reponsibility for our food and our collective actions
4	i think im a kid and dont know what the heck yor talking about
0	it will mean more for more
3	it is ######hat people arent cearing for our inviroment
3	because it could cost too much and we wouldn't have enough left over.
1	not a great recordin nzfor getting action underway.
0	we want to be good kaitiaki
1	I think fish deserve better :(((((((
1	THEY ARE A TREASURE AND NEED TIME TO REPLENISH
1	Fish caught susbably would be the answer however nbly or those who can afford it. One of the major problems is the distribution of wealth in society.
1	so then the indagered ones dont get extinct but every body in the world needs to do it.
1	Cause some fish are important and you need to be careful
1	im hope that they willdo this
0	it is much better for keeping things sustained
0	so the life of fish will never go out as in dead
2	Nothing g®ng t b? tht bd
3	lot  of people kill creatures for food and clothes
0	I think this is great.Everyone should do what they can to support the environment - it is our uture!
1	YES!             It just mkes sense if we even want to HAVE fish for much longer.
0	NZ was one of the first countries to have markets for "sustinable catch". Not sure it works. eh?
0	to keep fish tocks for the future
0	we should also be eating mre varieties of fish
0	i think this is a wonderful placeand i like how it is free
0	Save da fishies. I want my grandkids to be able to eat salmon.

1	i thik that we need two look after our fish
0	we need to preserve fish stocks for future generations
1	eople need to mae a change in ourdiets o help theworld survive
1	because it helps look after us and the earth
1	because  the fish wont go   extinct.
4	cause fish need to live or theyll become extinct and nobody likeswhen prices raze
3	if companies are paying more for fish they can't necicerily  use it towords protecting it.
1	it is crucial for everyone to realise where our food comes from and our role in consuming it and looking after the world for future generations
1	It's our planet and our job to keep it thriving. It will cost more but I think that would make less people eat fish which helps the aquatic population. Those who eat fish have the knowledge that it's not costing the planet as much as what we are doing currently. I'd love to see my beautiful home respecting the planet. In a culture of denial this would give me more hope for tomorrow
2	I dont buy fish from the supermarket
0	they shouldcare for the next generation
1	we are more aware of what ishappening
1	The world is dying andburning. Supermarkets needtojoin thec ause
1	catching fish more sustainably will reduce our carbon footprints which is of paramount importance to ensurethe longevity and efficiency of life on earth
0	because we should be doing absolutely everything we can to reduce the impact we have on our environment. ecosystem collapse would be a BIG bad
0	Fish have rights too #savethefish RESPECT THE OCEAN
1	i hope that this will help bring about the change we desperately need.
3	we should look after the fish as they are part of our world
0	i believe because we need to saveour oceans
0	as a chef the useof sustainable seafood will allow usto provide for future generations while still maintaining natural ecological balance
1	because theclimate needs help and we need to do everythibg to help it
1	it will help the planet long term
0	its important to promote sustainability to ensure a future for marine life
0	native fish should not be caught because they are part of our wildlife
2	i just dont care u got it
1	because we need to preserve some species for the future
0	there  should be no other option
0	Change happens when the individual consumer makes these kinds of choice
2	i just want of any type

0	its a great way to just buy nz fish
0	because the fish should be  alot cheaper so yeah its goodand i ont know what to put here
1	wow wow yer baby baby give it to me
1	anything that gives all species a chance to survive is worth trying
0	Reduces the  chances of species going extinct
1	because we want to leave something for the next generation...
1	this would ensure that better results are recorded for future generation
3	i am woried that the planet will die
3	because after we don't have sufficient food
1	There's a chance we can pull this off
1	because i wantbetterflys to be alive
3	Commercialism will reign regardless of what is best for the enviroment. So govt needs to make policies and laws to protect Aotearoa. Backed by science not business eg plastic bags were still used by supermarkets  even tho they knew it was bad. Then it was outlawed and we changed
3	if we dont change everything will die
2	a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q  r s t u
1	we have time to change....change what we eat  and how we live to save our planet
0	bc we cannot continue raping our seas and lands
0	killing animals for your own desire and profit is wrong. if the sea dies then we die
1	they should do it so fish do not go instinct
3	yuck fish is gross ADD ME ON FACEBOOK
1	because then we will have more fish in our oceans
4	how about no fish. We dont ned to eat them
0	Everthing is interconnected -  we have to protect our ecosystems delicate balance.
0	because we need to substain our wild life
0	i think it will help the environment and it will keep the fish safe too. its a great idea
2	i think it because i just do
1	i think fish need our help. we can do better
0	because thenpeople will take fishfor themselves and their family
1	Our impact on the enviroment is way to big and every minute destroy more and more of our planet. Sustaniable caught fish is a big step in the right way.
4	why dont we just stop eating fish altogether!!!    ®  hp? w? j®st  g®v? th? c?n  br?k
1	Beause we won't destroy the enviourment just for our right and need of food. But then again we do not have to eat fish. In conclusion I think if we were to eat fish often this would be a good salution.
1	This would be amazing but I am doubtful that this could happen. Overfishing is destroying delicate ecosystems and is an issue that needs to be adressed.
0	this will save the fish from becoming xtinct
1	i think its better forthe environment
1	i think it will help with some foods
1	i think its a good idea
1	I think a good point is whether or not the fish really is sustainably caught. While I agree that fish does need to be sustainably caught I am doubtful that this will happen. Overfishing especially by supertrawlers is a huge issue that is destroying delicate ecosystems and we need a solution.
1	beacause it is better fish an mabe a lower price
1	I am hopeful because we need to show action for our own planet we were given this planet to care for SO LETS START!

2	it would be who thinks which fish are sustaintable as the fisheriesz regualators in nz think they are alreadyfishing sustainably...
1	I think that we should be mre careful about how many fish we take from our ocean. we have them here in our world for a reason; and we cannot afford to lose them.
3	i think its all about money so to me they will never stop taking or conserving the fish they take.  its all about gread. IT ALL ABOUT MONEY.

0	its the right thing to do
1	because the  fish mite have less bugs in them
0	we need tolook after our resources

1	so we have enough fish to last for many generations to come.
2	i dont like seafood so dont really care
1	It will be better for our planet and save more of our sea life.
1	it could lead to the less sustainable species become more available to the point we can fish without risk

0	its the right thing to do
0	together we can make a difference
0	our oceans should be taken into more consideration!
1	because we may have no more fish for the future years... oh hell no
1	fresh should be cheap as chips
1	because i worry for the future of our sealife and aquatic ecosystems and would rather spend more money then cause irreversable damage.
0	so we dont make the fish extinct
1	sustainability is totally achievable but as a race we need to commit to some small sacrifice for greater change. Can we do it?
0	i think we reallyneed to do this sooner
1	i think this should have been implemented sooner but it will hopefully mean that less animals are harmed an hatthere is less pollution.
0	i hink we really need  to do this sooner.
0	becauseits better for the climateand fish
2	i dont really know what  this is about to be completely honest
3	I don't think people should kill fish even just for food.
4	i hate fish. they can succ my toes
2	lick me up im sweet and salty
4	fish taste better when they're full of  plastic
1	I cant be ecited forsomething that I am not sure will happen. However I would be excited if this was going to happen.
4	BECAUSE THEY SELL US PROCESED FOOD

4	there is no such thibg as sustanable fish atthe ratewe are catching it now
1	its a good idea that will helpalt of species
0	wwe should not be selling any fish  really because we do not farm them
2	it is not to my  intrest
3	we should understand our resources so we can harvest sustainably
0	If we choose to shop sustainably then business will have to meet that demand and change
1	Because now supermrkets are becoming more envirometaly friendly
1	because its a good idea and will save fish sharks and dolphins
0	to save fish species from beibg over fished
1	save our planet help us and our native birds
0	that this is a good idea so it doesn't decrease the population
0	so there is more to eat later
1	that is a good idea.but maybe we shouldn't be eating fish in the first place?
1	we should catch less rare fish but still have the chance to haave small amounts of things like snapper.
0	we need to be sustainable and protect our ecosystems for future
1	that we will get fish and that will make us happy and not hungry. i love  food!
0	This will protect the envinroment and the fish will be protected. Please  help save the envinroment and help our fish.

0	becauseit is good for th ocean
1	It would be great if they did take the idea and a good afect on the enviroment but same as climate change. it is a thing that  some people are not bothered to improve
0	if everybody does there bit including supermarkets we will all be living in a cleaner and healthier planet
1	it would just be better to leave more fish
1	Supermarkets should only take in a certain amount of fish a year to let the fish replenish
1	that this is a great idea
3	but how do you know if it isnt a sustainable caught fish
0	because my name is ## ####
1	i think it would be alot easer to do

0	there will be more fish and it is helping are enviroment
4	there wont be any fish left
0	I think it sounds good because it just does ok?
0	I think that all fish should be sustanable
1	I think that lots  of people would prefer to buy cheaper fish instead of sustainably sourced fish. However some people would want this including myself as Ithink its a great way to increase endangered fish populations.
1	because there would be more fish
1	because fish should not be harmed.
1	There would be more fish inthe world.
2	idk anything that much bc im ##
4	that people are taking too much fish from the ocean but thn im also angry because tgere are peple with heaps of kids ad might not beable to affored the shopping
4	I think fisher men are taking too much kai from the moana so big fish and shark won't have an even amount of kai to eat.
1	we need to stop selling fish completely and allow the oceans to replenish. but this is a good start....
2	i think that it should because it willstink
2	I don't really care if it costs more or less.
0	good fish is gd fash ayy
0	i think that is a very sensible idea
1	everyday we try to find a sustainable alternative however fish population diminishes due to the chinese/japanese fishing industry is rampent. follow my insta :-)
0	im excited beacsuse it will prevent hurting dolphins and penguins
0	this would be a great move towards ensuring species survive
1	im hopeful because this will help the oceans precious ecosystem abd we can then manage the amount of gases we produce ibto the atmsphere. its a start and i hope we can do more for ourenviroment. After all this is the only planet we have
1	i think that we should only kill what needs to be kill so that we can keep  difrent types of fish in our oceans for meany years to come!
2	i think i like fish and chips tonight
0	because there will be no more left soon
1	if we take action then perhapswe wont have to stopfishing altogether
0	we must stop being selfish and greedy. if we dont then earth is doomed.
1	that fish taste good so weve got to mke sure that there willalways be fish
0	otherise our oceans will be empty and dead
1	i think we should be more sustainable when catchfishh cuz fush taste good

1	i think  it should be  like that
1	I think itcan help gobal warming cometo a end. EVEN THOUGH T WILL COST MOREIT WILL HELP SAVE THE WORLD
0	its the only way to go
1	because we need to look after our fish stocks for future generations
1	because we need to look after are fish stocks for the future generations. if we dont look after it fish will soon be decreasing levels
0	if sustainably caught fish are forced to be the only sort of fishsold in markets then the fish will not decline and the native species won't go extinct from overfishing
0	My meals should not endanger earths taonga.
0	most of the time you dont even know what youre purchasing
0	Most fisheries are not sustainable but people support them anyway. Having only sustainable options available would be a faster solution to creating sustainable fisheries than relying solely on market forces/consumer choice.
0	it gives you satisfaction that you are buying fish that is sustainably fishes and is not bad mistreated baby fish. also that you csn go to the supermarket and buy any of the fish that is supplied
0	Because it will help take care of the environment.
1	Its unlikely.  People care more about money
0	it shouldnt be mre expensive than it already is. people dot eat that much tht often
1	because we need to sart looking after our planet
0	i think this creates more accontability within the fishbg industry and will drive prices down
2	The world will go under- with or without sustainaby caught fish. The reaction of the earth to the pollution of us humans is called natural selection to clean up the mess we've made.  Hope the world will be better without us humans.
0	fish wouldlke to be caught tha way owo
1	we are the kaitiaki but right now the food industry isnt making sustainable choices accesible to all. Buying sustainably caught fish is a luxery for the rich. im hopeful that education on the environmental crisis will push for grassroots change on the way we source process and view food.
1	so the fish do not die.
0	so there is fish for everyone forever
1	it will let more fsh live and make our seas more naural and fishful
1	it would be good for the ebviroment if we caughtlessofit but the goverment should rise the pay ammount evrryone getso that we can payforit

2	cause i dont care when im with mybaby yea
0	it is time to be more mindful about human impact on the natural world. there are so many opportunties ahead to practice conservation and new ways of seeing!
1	If we contiue to catch more fish than th ecosystom allows. then there won't be fish left! If supermarkets fish sustainably. then there will be more fish left in the ocean... and less food waste!!
1	i lke to eat chicken nuggies im very fat ###
1	govt needs to do more toreguate so this happens
0	thats its better for the eco sysem
1	it culd work butwill they do it
2	i eat my toes so i dont need  fish
4	we have known for so long that commercial fishing is destroying sea bed and depleting stocks but no law change has happened

3	we dont need to eat fish. go vegan to save theplane.
1	having supermarkets selling fish that are no endangered in any srt of way would b better forther exsistance and their line of fish. whe you go to thesupermrketandi see   the endangerd fish it decuss me s i feel hopeful for our nativefish in aotearoa
2	idk natemea kaore au e kai ika
0	he taonga te ika. he tino kai
4	we should be doing this already! It might be too late!
1	i think that the fish wont get extinct
1	I feel hopeful because people should have clean healthy and good fish. Ofcourse it must be easier to sell any kind of fish anywhere with probably some desease. But infact it really shouldn't matter the price but the kind of fish you get and from where. This is a problem because if people an unhealthy and sick fish people themselves would get sick and you wouldn't want; that would you you? Thats why I feel hopeful.
1	to be honest we shouldn't be eating fish anyway or any meat products. im hopeful because only "sustainable" sourced fish sold in Aotearoa supermarkets would be a step in theright direction.
1	THIS WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE WERE MORE FISHERMEN TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND
1	because I will still be able to eat fish
1	i thinkthat it is good to help survive natives speies
0	We have to takecare of our fish or our oceon will be empty
0	non endangered fish and fish of the right size should be caught and taken to the fish market to be sold. the endangered species of fish and the undersized fish should stay in the sea to keep growing.preserve the fish supply .Long live the fishes/sea creatures!!!
0	it is good for our environment and we will always have fish if we do this SAVE THE FISH
0	the seal population is droppibg fast due to a lack of food so we really need to start fishibg sustainably
1	i dont believe thatsa greatidea as fish is already expensive
3	I think its a okay idea cause we could make them endangred.
0	ITS ALWAYS FEEL GOOD TO BE HAPPY
0	otherwise we will not have fish anymre
0	i think thatif supermarkets would supply sustainable fish it would be better for our environment in the future because the ocean will have the right amont of marine life.
0	i think thatsupermarketsshoulsonlysell sustanable fish beasasce otherwise we will have none left in our ocean and also money can non bye nature
0	Because over-fishibg is a serious threat and could wipe out all of the edible fish. We should set up breeding areas in order to preserve our diverse aquatic life.
0	because i would like my children to be able to eat fish in the future
0	because it is good for the enviourment
0	Doing this would help the enviroment
0	it feels good to know that im nourshing my body without negatively affecting our environment
0	SO THERE WILL BE FISH TO BUY IN THE FUTURE
1	i think we should sell sustainibility fish
1	I want to be just as able to eat fish and chips in 2050 as I am today.
0	if supermrket only provide sustainable options people will eat sustaibably
0	IT IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
1	BECAUSE IT WOULD BE MORE BETTER AND RECCOMENDED FORHUMANS.
1	I will cost more butitwill be worth it if fish don't go extinct
1	if we dobt have to choose veteen this abd the other itwill be easeto be sustainae
1	It would be a great idea for our society but whether it happens or not is another story
1	otherwise we may lose whole populations and ecosystems
0	its the right thing for the planet. overfishing leads to mass extinction for our benifit
0	time to focus on people before profit
1	ITS WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR FUTURE
0	i would be happy to pay more to help our planet
0	Supermarkets should generally sell more suintable goods
2	i dont eat alot  of fish
4	because if we eat the fish the fish might have oil in it so that is why i am angry
0	i can keep hving more healthy fish
1	I think this would be an important step in the right direction in order to save our planet - so let's do it!
0	yeah bro Fuck yeah bro i love fishing
0	sounds good t me man :)
0	i like fish. theyre pretty . subscribe to brooksi on spotify
1	sustainable food production and consumption is the first step towards enviro sustainabily
0	i quite like fish and extinction would make me sad lol
1	food should be sold sustainably so thereis food for the future.
1	This would be a good idea except for the fact that tohave ths as a global effort we would need to check every single boat and run extensive surveystoweed unsustainable practices out.
1	We must think of future generations. What will they do without an important part of the human diet? We must also think of the animals that prey on fish. We could be causing even more species to go extinct.
0	because this option reflects thetrue price of animal consumption on our planet
1	its the ethical thing to do
0	to sustain numbers for the future
1	because it would be better forthe environment and the fish would not become extincted
0	save the ecosystem. only use what is eeded
0	if we make sure that our fisheries are sustainably managed now then future generations will eb able to enjoy these resources too
1	there will be more fish for the future generations
1	for the greater good. it is the right thing to do
0	that if the fishing industry has to exist that it shouldbe through sustainable means only.
0	i think that if we use stanible caught fish all the time then compnays that fish unstanbly will change
1	i hope it happens but i think it will take a while
1	because it creates hope for sustaibability  within other sectors as well. This is just the beginning. Someone has tolead thecharge.
1	We need to change the public mindset first otherwise the supermarkets will say they are just responding to consumer demand in purchasing and supplying fish.
1	That sounds like a great idea!
0	i   thinkit is a good idea
3	its a big issue and we should do better
1	i think that meats of any kind should be only stocked if ethically sourced
0	that  it is fair becauseotherwise fish could go extinct
0	it excites me to think that we could be proactive and take vital steps towards caring for the life in our oceans. we are just a small country but every little thing makes a difference.
0	id rather cut backon unecessaryluxuries  to be a betterhunab
0	we should be more aware of the impact of our eating habits.
1	because we need to preserve the earth
1	if tht happend it would change so much  in our rivers. more native fish would show up and i think it just would be great!!!
1	i think its better because all tge other fish wont be gone
0	FISH ARE VERY OFTEN NOT FARMED making them an at risk resourse
3	we need to keep sea creatures alive to experience the culture of homes and the ocean fish should live
4	we should keep fish alive !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1	kaiden thinks this is a good idea!
0	out of sight out of mind is damaging our enviroment. i feelheart broken seeing many of our species being slowly wiped out
0	to preserve the oceans habitats and ecosystems

2	its a good way to it sgshrsgfshkj
0	cause im lerning new things wich is exiting
3	cause i dont know whats next
1	cause its not fair if we dot look after our fish
0	because removal of a species of fish from a marine environment results in a greater negative effect on other species and plants in the ecosystem therefore sustainable fishing is essential for future health of our oceans.
1	cuz it hels the environment and also helps marine life keep going so that our human being can enjoy the seafood while guilt-free.
2	foodcan be expensive andim on a benefitbut  it woud still be good for  the oceans
1	sustainibility is necissary fr the future
0	Everything we do comes back on Papat®nku so we need to be sustainable and resourceful.
0	because  otherwise we will run outof fish for the world
1	because  we  need to worrie about our future like nature  took care of us so we need to do the same
0	dont want fish to go extinct
0	we should take care of our fish stocks to maintain the balance created in nature over millions of years
1	so fish stocks stay naturally high
1	it eans there will be fish for future generations to enjoy and will keep our oceans alive
0	Beacause itis better for our bodies and health.Sustainabilityis also better for everything.
1	we will lose marine biodiversity unles we treasure our marine species as much as the iconic land specie
0	we should do more to provide sustainable products
1	protect a dwindling resourc and to improve oceanic health.
1	Important for so many health benefits to still have fish to eat but lets give future geneations that choice    we dont know all there is to know but we do know how to conserve and protect so lets do it
0	because it is good for the planet
1	because it helps us have a more sustaibable enviroment for ears to come
0	BECAUSE M¦M S?¦D S?. MUM ISALWAYS RIGHT
0	because its the right thing to do
1	it is time we took responsibility

0	fish is good and should be enjoyed sustainably now so future generations can too
3	hey my name is ######. good luck ####### xox
0	theres no higher price than causing the extinction of any of earths beautiful creatures or the collapse of its ecosystems
1	if not there will be no more to eat
1	it  will have long range benefits.
3	to many people dont care.all these young folk protesting at present about climate should practice what they preace.stop going to all these fast food joints filling up the place with plastic ect ect.how many of them fly ect.when that happen.smaybe we might start to improve.
0	i am excited because  i get to see new things in te papa
1	i think  we needpeople to understand theagricultural damage we are doing long term and the long costs involved if we dont do this.
1	i think we need people to understand the agricultural damage we are doing. we are being short sighted.
0	nature is more important than enything else
0	if fishing is done sustainabley it will be around and affordable for longer
1	sustainable foods may become the new form of currency.
3	we are soon to be running out of fish one way or other us wasting the life of one fish is worser then any can imgae
1	people are thinking more about their impacts so even if localization of food and specificlly fish doesnt happen we moving in the right direction. will that be enough
1	I would support this but I don't know if most of the public would agree
1	i think its important to promote sustainable fishingifwe wabt to continue to consume fish in the future. prices are inevitable but it pays off in the end
1	people are becoming more aware of the need to have sustainability
2	i dont now what it means im 9 years old
0	sustainability comes with a price that we have to pay.
1	Better expectation for marine life in future
2	very consumer life ilive. just want ease of my own  life
1	hey panini why you such a ######

1	we need to protect our world for the future
3	theres always some country  trying to break the   rules
0	Because of the way we are fishing a lot of delphins are dying.
0	Because I want there to be more fish in the ocean
0	we have a chance to help expand the fish population for generations to come. ecosystem needs our support
1	because we all need to play a part
1	i think we should eat sustinability food for our future
1	i think if wecould realize howwe influence to the other life. we can chose the future. we can take care. or we ignoire. i chose itake care
4	im not allowed to eat ### ####### cookies
3	south africa might beat japan in rwc
2	drinks in town are too expensive
3	who want smoke? you want smoke?
2	my lads stay ambitious.keep that hush low on business
1	we should think more about which products we are consuming and which impact that has on our environment
0	taking care of animals in general
1	so then morefish will b in the oceans
1	to avoid overfishing and protect our ecosystems
0	the environment is our most important asset. we need to protect it and be sustainable
1	If it does help then it will reduce the amount of change we put  on the enviroment
0	This museum gives me hope that we can care for our planet and all that live here.
0	the commons dilemma. either share and prosper long term or be selfish and ruin the planet for our future children.
1	I think that its a step in the right direction for healing the world we live in. I hope it continues
1	We have a responsibility to look after this world.
3	everyone should be worried about where their food comes from.
1	It would be a great way to keep eating fish in a sustainable way.
1	I think it is neccesary to car about animals and how they are treated  or otherwise one day no fish will be left
1	Faiure to sustainably source fish will have a wider impact on the marine ecosystems and could lead to further population reductions in other species.
1	putting the earth before monetry gain means we're moving in the right direction- gratitude instead of entitlement.
1	man kills 10 million fish a day! go vegan instead
1	if we dont there wil be nothing left to catch
1	because they should protect our marine life.
1	because we need to protect what we have and only eat sustainable supplies
1	we need fsh to survive well into the future
1	While there needs to be more done to protect the existing marine life I don't believe action wil be take before it's too late.
1	if all supermarkets did this it wouldn't be a problem because all competitors would be selling at around the same price and it would be more sustainable.
0	excited because it is taking us to a greater future
1	im hopeful that this will be come a reality because it will hep our earth.
1	that is a good idea  so that. yeah.......
1	I hope everyone can agree that we need to do this even if itinconveniences some
1	I think it won't  be anytime soon.
1	It's better for the enviroment  animals and the human body
3	but what is sustainable fishing?  farms?
0	so we can keep eating fish
1	I am hopeful thisoccurs more often
4	if you want to eat a fish catch it yourself.
0	because thefishcan grow again then the fish can grow again then we can cach it again
1	I am hopeful for this because we are then not catchibg more fish than we need and preventing them to regrow again. I do not think it should be too expensive because people need protein and need to be abe to afford it.
1	I  think that preserving the ocean starts with being responsible about the way we fish.
1	It means those who will fish sustainably will be rewarded.
0	we need to  go to extreme lengths to protect our oceans and the animals who live there.
0	so we  dont outfish the oceans by over consuming and demand. then generations to come can enjoy our marinelife and world too
1	we seem to be moving in this direction with incresing momentum
1	because this is better for our earth
1	i think this can help usto keep our beautiful nature as it is
1	we share this earth we do not own it or our fellow creatures
2	because i dont eat fish as much as my family
0	I am excied because fish tast like samon
0	we need to think about the future
0	It enables more people who would otherwise abstain from eating fish to eat without guilt. It would also strengthen the connection between source of fooda nd what is on our plates. I believe this is the most crucial step in bettering our eating habits for ourselves and the environment. Knowledge is power!
1	majority of people are on board but the culture has to change around it
0	it is a sign of respect and gratefulness towards the earth which nourishes us.
1	### ### want to eat salmon
1	mor mor Mine like to eat salmon
1	Current fishing practices generally are not well targetted and take everything leading to a lot of waste.
0	only take what youn need and look after our ecosystem. we only have one planet. there is no plan b!
0	because its time to help our  future food  resourses
1	it takes too long to transport
0	we should respecttheirlives and how they support the wider ecosystem
3	i dont think it will happen sadly
1	Future generations will be able to enjoy seafood as well. Improves the health of the ocean
4	lack of data to define sustainable. fund my phd i will gather some.
1	I would hope that not only would it reduce wastage but it would also mean that generations to come could also enjoy the fresh seafood we can enjoy here.
0	its important for business to become caretakers not just takers
0	everything is going to have to cost more for morality
1	it will be a step in the right direction
4	It would hurt the New Zealand fishing industry. Absolutely against it.
0	ethical production and consumption aligns with my ideological values
4	morewide range of methamphetamine would begood
1	it will hopefully allow fish in our oceans to thrive
0	because balance is needed to survive for everything and we should preserve life as much as possibe
1	its importnt but dont think itwill happen
0	So that we can have fish for generations to come
0	comercial fishing is no good stop pillaging our moana
0	fish for generations to come to enjoy
0	its the only way to still keep fish in our waters. speak with your wallet
0	be great to protect them and ensure we are eating healthy clean fish
1	it is better for the world
0	Guaranteed quality if monitored correcly andprotects local fish suppliers
3	IT IS CRUEL BECAUSE  DOLPHINS AND TURTLES GET CAUGHT AND  DIE
0	we dont have the right to helpourselves to everything . humans are a greedy species.
0	less poaching and more fish in the ocean for future generations
1	increase recreational catches for future generation
0	to keep more fish in the sea
0	we must preserve our planet wild life and plant life
0	Ease of food access has increased consumption and with it depletion
1	if supermakets make this change it will help us save the oceans by not giving the average consumer a choice
1	More people will be educated about the importance of ocean resources
0	we need to change peoples behaviour
1	you can actually choose the actal right size
0	small things help but actully having it happen is probably impossible
1	I hope that people do  the right thing even if its not convient
1	its getting more and more important to keep and save our beautiful and unique fauna and flora. there is enough choice of other fish you can eat
0	we need a sustainablefood chain to be supportive of our enviroment
0	you shouldnt sell fish at all...
1	i think a step in the right direction
0	BECAUSE WE WANT FUTURE HOWEVER NOWADAYS I CANNOT DISTINGUISH WHOSE WORDS WE CAN BELIEVE
0	if people didnt have the option it would become the norm
1	I want the worlds creatures to increase not decline.
0	Sustainability is the only way forward
0	Because oceans need stronger protection laws as every fish and animal in the ocean is an important part f theecosstem. If we overfish other oceab animals will die and the ecsystem will become inbalanced.
3	we  should look after our world
0	I think it is one of the most effective ways to protect our fisheries
1	so i can make an informed choice about eating responsibly and support sustainable innovative business and help nature to stay strong and healthy
0	thay  need  to  look after them   more
1	could meanfor a mre sustainable future
0	because we have only one world and shud take care of it!
0	fish stocks are severely depleted. we need to manage this or suffer the consequences. in effect by paying a higher price now we can give back to our children what our less sensible parents have deprived us of.
1	We need to learn to live within our means
0	New Zealand has a terrible rputation for marine conservation and depth of trawler fishing. This would be a good start
0	IF THE COST REFLECTS THE ACTUAL INPACT ON MARINE LIFE MAYBE PEOPLE CAN MAKE BETTER INFORMED CONSUMPTION DECISIONS.
1	bc wehave lots of those fish
0	because it would mean that our future generations can enjoy the same things that we enjoy
1	Hopeful because we can have more fish in the ocean and help them thrive better.
0	because they won'trun out of fish in the sea
0	because commercial fishing is destroying fish stocks as a whole and now you can baely ever catch reasonably sized fish off the shore
1	i think we can save the world
0	i am excited for this as people would see the value in sustainability and keepig ourwildife safe
0	it   means we are thinking of ocean life in a responsible way
0	economies of scale dont align with naturalresources

1	hopefully it helps repopulate the ocean
3	i dont think would eat  fish. They dont eat us so why eat them?
4	why do we need to eat fish. They dont eat us sowhy eat them?
0	i think sustainability of ecosystems is more important than eating fish. Eating fish is a luxury not a necessity.
1	i hope that if supermarkets stop selling unsustainably harvested fish maybe they will also change prices/ produce according to eco footprint
1	Without the means and the will to defend our fisheries NZ will continue to be plundered by overseas fish factories withput penalty rendering any thing we do in our waters somewhat impotnt
1	hopeful that people are starting to think like this. but will it be soon enough
0	people are so aware now especially young people but even older like myself are making positve changes and talking about it on social media

0	if we dont start sustainably fishing therell be nothng left
1	There is a growing awareness of sustainability in food supply however the main focus of supermarkets and a lot of producers remains profit regardless of environmental cost.
1	producers and sellers need to work together to maintain fish stock environments and educate consmers on where their food comes from and what cost it comes at ; environmental and consumer prices
1	this could place an unfair burden on people wit low incomes. perhaps govt could help subsidize sustainable practices

1	this would mean future generation woud be able to see the fish an enjoy it like all before us
0	without immediate wide scale action - to the point of our discomfort we wont even have this as an option as eological feedback processs will inevitably cause population collaspe. further scarcity promotes value and savouring when enjoyed

0	we need yummy fish.i dont like fish
0	i think it will be challenging because  its classic example of tragedy of the commons or lack of property rights hw we can reduce our consumption via paying more....but this may not be popular?
0	we are runningout oftime to conserve our sea life..once it is overfished. it  is gone foralways
1	I think that it is very good idea.  having a longer lasting suply of fish would help many generations to come  have a better knowing  of the fish and of the past
3	i love you you love me
1	rather than priortising profit and short term gratification. as a civilisation that wants to survive we need to start thinking more long term.
3	i think nz is doing a good job of protecting us
1	we need to consider replenishing the stocks
4	quit eating  anything that had a face or a mumma

2	dont et fish only from chip shop :)
0	to maintain nz fish species supermarkerts should support fisherie businesses to only supply sustainable fish.this would support consumer education.
0	we need to stop thinking about how much money it costs and instead think about the cost tothe environment
1	it would make fisheries and business more sustainable
0	that fishies are rare and all that blah blah blah
2	i hobestly dont care. i dont buy fish so i dont take much notice. iam also worried because i dont want the ocean to be eeyty
1	Awareness is being raised about important ecological isues
1	i  think    because  when theres no  fish in the sea lots of animals well die
0	this would be a great idea. we only have one planet and we need to look after our oceans
1	i think the sea is enporeternt  because  theres tons of animals in the sea
1	This is a good idea. It may take a while to implement but shoud help inthe long run.
0	preserving not only certain species of fish but also foodchains and in turn the whole marine system
1	we need to monitor the oceans not rape it
1	i think what we take from nature we must give back. we are all one.

1	i rip the most hectic cones ever i got0. 3  ftin
0	it is algood bc it has dtail withn all the creatures
3	because we might lose all our fish
1	im worried about fish stocks and depletion of this resource
0	We have to support the ecosystem best we can.
0	by selling sustainable fish you are helping the environment
1	the common species are over fished   we need to achieve a balance in the  oceans ecosystem
1	there should definitely be MORE sustainably caught fish. it just needs to stay affordable for everyone.
3	concerened that this may result in maori still able to catch what they want when they want and everyone else will have to abide byvery strict rules that somehow minority groups will be exempt from having to follow.
0	so we have some left for the next generration
1	logistics of operation means more damge to the natural environment
0	im exited coz this place is socoland wemight go shopping
0	if we want to still be alive in 100 years we need to start now by looking after what we have and makng positive change
0	FIshing has significant impacts on fsh populations. popn dynamics of many of the tsrgeted popns are unknown so the impacts are untraceable and possibly extensve. intensive fishing decreases prey for ou natve speies e.g. yellow eyed penguins and bycatch of sae lions nd yeos and dolphins and seabirds is decimsting thrirpopns
1	money rules all. if it becomes cheaper to fish sustainablythen maybe...but dont hold your breah.
0	because te papa is my favourite place in wellington
0	very modern and so much to learn
0	There would be hope for our oceans to recover from over fishing
0	we are wrecking our planet by overfishing the oceans. the best way to recover involves stopping consumer demand for products that are not sustainable.

1	i dont wantour fish species eradicated
3	fish is an importnt provider of calcium and protein. its already too expensive for most fsmilies. ALLOW PRIVATE CITIZENS to sell thir extra catch to the public..
0	it would be more sustainable long tern
0	Having a wide variety of fish for sale is beneficial for seafood companies
1	this relies on people being able to afford it
0	i feel it would let fishpopulatin stustanable
1	it maybe unaffordable for many families
4	they should just think more about a good solutionfor everyone. not hard....
1	we should dothis so that we have more fish in the ocean
1	i think this will be good  because the yellow eyed penguins would have more food
0	fish dont get fished out to extentoin
0	MUMMY DONT LET FISHY EAT ME...
0	FISHY DONT DIE I WANT U TO STAY IN MY FISHTANK...   WAAAAAAAA!!!
0	cos there will be nomoreplastichopefullyvin the fish abd fish x can be igger abd jucie and nicer
0	It means a lot more fish will have a chance to survive which will help maintain our frgile ecosystem's balance.
0	I am from Seattle Washington and we are running out of fish back there so it would be nice if New Zealand could have some
0	because then thefishhave a chance ofregenerating
1	sustainable ecosystems are more important than me saving a few dollars.
0	postive step every lttle and big thibg cons
3	the solution is not sustainable fishing. it is stop using animals toour own benefit #gv?gn
1	The sustainability of our kaimoana market ensures it's survival. Our people have been living off the moana and whenua for so long and thatis now in jeopardy
1	i think that it is good a tepapa
0	the fishes caught unsustainably harms the entire water life. turtles; dolphins; etc gets caught and sone of the species are on the verge of extinction. Supplements like fish oil made from unsustainably caught fishes are harmful for human health as well.
0	that if i see through then it will be fine438
0	so they will last forever for generations
1	its better forthe enviroment. cheaper longterm affect
2	let the consumer make the choice at the checkout
0	because more sustainable fish is better because it would kill less fish
0	I BELIEVE WE NEED TO CARE FOR OUR PLANET BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
0	unsustainable fishing is wrong and short sighted
0	i m exieited because the worlds oceans might be changed
0	Everything we do should strive to be sustainable otherwise we wont be sustained.
0	excited for the future of sustainable living
4	i'ts bad why make it expensive if it only small fish
4	fish is living creature u know market
4	fish is like chicken. almost everyone eat chicken and fish so my idea is that if you find a dead fish you can eat it. do the same to chicken.
2	there is plenty of fish in the world
0	it would be very great and caring about our earth.
0	need to look after stocks fr future
1	ko te ika me te hauoratanga o te moana me ngai maori te   mea nunui ki u.
1	howdo we know that fish is caught sustainibily
2	Need more information first...the statement even says "...sustainability is not clear"
1	Supermekets should definitly be selling sustainable fish it is a great start to becoming a mainly sustainable world and helping all the speices on the planet.
1	supermarkets should definitily be selling sustanable fish
0	it would be great and a step forward
1	i think we should start thinking about being sustainable
2	that more cheap fish means more sush
0	because i want to eat   fish forever
3	people value this planet likewe should. we should be protecting it not abusing it
1	because sustainabily will secure our future but i worry that profit and greed will sometimes take over.
1	i think we shouldonly be selling sustainably caught fish. itwould be great to see this policed better.
0	i think it should be a law that all products used to sell or make money from should be harvested sustainably and any externalities like wilding pines should be the responsibility of those turning the profit NOT the tax payer...
0	the most important istotake after our nature
1	hopeful caues this wouldbe good for the envirnoment
0	I want future generations to enjoy seaafood too!
1	humans are greedy. we need to learn to use only what resurces we need ratger than cobsuib he planet.
1	it would be great but not sure of large fishing companies gettingon board.
0	I think that everything we eat  should be sustainable or else we are all going to die
0	because if we keep fishing like we are we will have fishless oceans and will mess up our whole ecosystem.
1	because there is too much over fishing in our waters
1	i want the fish grounds to increase abountly
4	I want all fish to be happy
4	i don't want prices to go up
1	i would rather there be NO fish sold...but sustainble is better than nothig
1	Fishing needs to be very carefully monitored.
1	to preserve the fsh we have left
1	because we want to keep the fishs
1	fresh fish natively caught are the ony economic option to be taking
0	having a source offish that takes into acount the conservation of those fish and theirenvironments is very exciting! Conserve the planet my peeps!
0	fishing nets produce so much waste in our oceans so much that if all he plastic straws in the world went in to the ocean right now it would account for less than one percent of the plastic in the ocean
4	Fish are friends - not food.
0	IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AFTER THE ENVIRONMENT HUMANS! NYEH HEH HEH!
1	It's important for the economy. But having a sustainable food source is important too.
4	because they are herting the birds
3	I am worried that people still think that seafood is a sustainable food resource. The oceans are depleted.
0	i think it is good idea nig
0	Regardless of costs we should be looking at creating a more sustainable future.
0	we need to protect our wildlife incluidng sealife
1	This would be a step in the right direction and a good starting point for the rest of the industries to wake up and realise without rapid immediate change there will be no resources left for future generations
0	this is a great initiative that should be put in place in all industries.
0	long term survival of fish and the fishing industry
0	we are part of the ecosystem and should care about other species too ibce they nake it possible foruto lve
0	because fish arevery impotant tokeeping our world healthy
1	we need to concern the ocean while consuming
1	it'll be better for the enviroment.
0	im excited for new thoughts ideas and questions regarding the environment
1	to sustainably market fish would be better for the environment. thats what makes me hopeful to do better for the environment. we cant expect resources to last forever the way we are using them
0	cause we need to  stop eating our animals
1	because i hope everone will live togother
4	fist is good for our body abd stuff
0	that it would be god for our seas
1	we are capable as a team

0	because we want to keepthe earth pretty and ethicalas long as possible
1	I Love it because we need to look after our planet

1	we need to work as a team in order to help
3	no on realises the big issue
4	we might run out of fish
1	If we keep over fishing there will be nothing left for future generations

1	to ensure future generations can enjoy the things we havenow
1	on paper it sounds great but i doubt this world can make it happen
1	i wantmy great grandkids to have some fish left in the sea for them
0	because our beautiful planet and its animals deserve better
1	Ithibk that this wouldbe helpful for the enviornment and worththe cost
2	I don'tlike to have fish so i won't afect me.
0	Sustainability is what will save our world
1	that we are depleating our fish and maby killing endangered sea animals
3	Some people cannot afford expensive but sustainable options
1	it is so awesome that people are starting to make conscientious decisions. however i believe that we should keep fish and other sea animals completely off our plates!
1	people are becoming more aware of their power as consumers. price matters though so it needs to be you can not buy cheap fish.....
1	from my perspective as a fishermen our fishing managment system is one of the best systems in the world for sustanabiity
1	i thinks sustainable fishing is so important bu t worryabout making healthful food morei naccessible
2	because its just a dumb old thing
4	because its not a good price abd not fair.....
2	kia ti tuku o taki taha ite b132
4	i thibk tht they are hurtingour fih by even eating it why not just be vegtearian like where running out of animalspeople

1	it would be great if hunanities' days aren't numbered.
1	that it would befaironthepublic abd dggsgsfs
0	its a great idea and pinkhair will then look stunnin
3	it will becometoo expesive for me to enjoy
0	SUSTAINABILITY ROCKS and people need to get woke
1	we have to preserve the ressources
0	If we don't stop the number of fish being caught there will be none left. Sustainably catching fish is the best way to prevent extinction of fish without removing it from our diets altogether
1	So manyspecies hav already died out because of human behaviour. Its time to change that and with every little step that we take towards a more balanced world we will live a more pleasant and healthy live
1	this would be better for the future
1	in the market  the sellers sell it on a veryhigh price
0	we will contribute towards a sustainable environment
1	as hard as it is it will ensure populations survive. everything in moderation
1	and i hope that this wish will soon become more realistic. in fact like a normal thing
1	its a good idea nd might might work
1	We should start thinking more about our future
0	we should save our planet and take careof environment
0	although no fishing at all is better sustainability is at least an improvement #govegan
2	There will be no actions below 400ft AGL except cancel any warnings and raise landing gear with a positive rate of climb.
0	because if we catch fish that there arnt as many of theywill go extint.
0	without sustainability we will eventually run out of fish to eat. I would rather ration and eat fish occasionally than never eat fish again.
1	it is good for the environment
0	its important to do whatever we can to try and save this planet.
1	i think this wouldbe moregood forbthe panet
1	i think the enviroment would appriciate it and we coud enjoy more kai moana in th fuure
0	it is very important to keep our oceans biodiversity
1	it is only a start but its better than nothing
0	because our fish are important to us  and we need to catch them sustainably or else over fishing can cause a massive loss to the popultion
1	its a beginning to encourage  others
1	to preerve a healthy and diverse ecosystem for futuregenerations
1	we need to protect our wildlife
1	it is important for our eco system that theres enough
1	our generation has the ability to make great change; why not start with sustainable food production/consumption.
1	CHANGE DA WORD MY FINAL MESSAGE GOODBYE ...
0	thiswould mean that less fishwould be more free to live
2	i think that u shoud go do a ####
3	what about people who cannot afford it?
0	We need to protect our fish and oceans by implementing sustainable fishing  practices
3	overfishing and  always wanting more. has become normal
0	that it may not have to be real
0	because we will be able to have more fish for the future
4	this is not cool of the staffed cat
1	i think hopefull because they wont be extinct
1	because i be nice to people
3	oh no oh no the indoesian kids wil goout of work
1	good idea but will take a while to get through
0	so thereis more fish in thesea
1	To sustain we must maintain.  When it is dead and gone there is no hope folk.
1	It is the right thing to do but the rule probably will not come into effect untill much later on.
4	because they dont do it already
4	I am appalled that we have to makethis rule. All items shouldbe sustainablycaught or grown anyway.
1	I am hopeful that they will begin this soon
1	I am hopefulthat maybe one dayit will be that way with all foods. After all a world without hope isn't really a world.
0	Because they WILL do this soon
3	we should all be worried DUH othrrwise it will never happen
1	A WORLD WITH NOTHING ON IT IS NOT A WORLD. IT IS A BARREN PLANET. THIS SMALL STEP IS THE START OF A LONG JOURNEY. AFTER ALL IT IS THE SINGLE DROPS THAT REFRESH THEPARCHED GROUND
1	IF WE DONT START CARING WE WILL ALL DIE DUN DUN DUN
0	We must allow Mother Earth to sweep her skirts across our land and return it to the original dance of nature.
2	i dont really know what to do
0	because weneed to maintain our enviroment
1	eat sustainably. leave some for others
2	i am vegan. better not to fish
0	because i have never been here before
4	give me my phone now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	we need to ensure we sill have fish in the future and not damage the ecosystem
1	better for nature and better for us. but is it possible with all population
1	it is importantti maintain the species for the future generation
0	helps us maintain a healthy earth
1	Selling onl ystustainably cought fish is a step in the right direction. But regardless animals get killed and more then half the ocean plastic comes from the fishing industry. IS there really a way to catch fish sustainably. Eat plants instead.
0	that it could help our oceas to strive
0	farming poisons the environment and without sustainablequotas overfishing leads to exhausting resources etc
0	we should help fish thrive by  only selling sustanably cought fish
0	it would help to protect undersea grouds and wildlife. saying thisare we ready to pay now?
0	larger businesses  need to take the lead with sustainable practices
1	THAT IT WILL HELP SAVE OUR PLANET AND LEAVE RESOURSES FOR OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS
0	so the sea can be restored
1	this should always be the case for produce but humans are money hungry and selfish
0	Because it is their responsibility as the seller of a good to ensure it is ethically produced
0	in my life as a fisherman i have seen a decline in the life in the ocean. if some firm of action is not taken then future generations wonthave a chance to see and experience any of the sea life i have
3	i am fisherman  . i fish for food for my family. nofish anymore. my wife divorce me.i never see my children anymore. please send help nz government
0	sustainable fishing for fture generatiobs :))))
1	going vegan is the best idea for environmental  hope but if people must eat fish then definitely sustainable is best
1	because of the biodiversity in the ocean
1	we aint here for long but the earth is
0	sustaining our fish populations and species is important  enough   to pay a litle more. Come on Aotearoa.
0	Personally I can survive without it
1	I'm hopeful because I think we need change
3	here is no sustainablefishing. we will have fishless oceans by 2050 if we continue the way we are... even if it isupposedly the most sustainable option

2	peoplehave to eat something better than grass and bark!
1	it would be awesome but enough people have to care
1	at least someone is trying to do something about it
0	et bien car les poissons ne doivent pas etre extermines
1	we need fish in the ocean to survive
0	THE EARTH IS DYING WE NEED TO CARE FOR HER
3	because seaweed isnt good for you
1	we need to care for all aspects of our beautiful planet.  we should love and respect where we live
1	got to learn to live better to survive cant eat ourselves into extiction
1	its a step in the right direction and should also apply to petfood. all supermarket chains should be audited for plastic waste
1	th idea is admirable but cost to the consumer drives change ....if fish is expensive the average kiwi wont buy it and the fishingindustry will stagnate....too many intersts and too much money is involved to make voluntary change...
0	this is better for the envirent
1	The ocean was once descrbed as "inexhaustable". Unfortunatley this has proven not to be the case
0	because it would be a big step to protect our planet
0	i think it is really important that all our food is sustainable
1	it helps theenviroment and the economy
1	hopful for me but less fortunite should have a choice
0	because more peoplecan et tht fish in the future
0	Fish is a luxury good and should be priced accordingly
0	the current initiative to be plastic free is a positive move
2	we need to police the fishing fleets better
0	Because humans should struggle just as much as they struggle to survive - ###############
0	I am an Italian marine biologist. In Europe is very difficult manage the sustainability of a stock. Do it in New Zealand could encourage the EU countries to do the same. Together we are more strong!
0	because fishes are important for a functional ecosystem
0	####### hat ne ##### mene und ### nen ####### sipp
0	there should not be any other fish other than sustainably sourced
1	PEOPLE SHOULD REDUCE THEIR SEAOOD INTAKE
1	then the fish could have more timeto reproduce.
0	It should be necessary. We need to preserve our oceans.
0	would be class so it would
1	my names ###### im # and i like fish
1	the world  i moving in a direction that the market must adapt to or go out of  business.
1	because it will mean there is more fish in our oceans to feed families in the future
0	because it safe to our land and to our sea
0	THE FISH IS A GIFT THAT NATURE GIVES US. IT IS NOT OUR RIGHT TO JUST TAKE IT AS WE PLEASE. WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL AND ACT WITH RESPECT. SUSTAINABILTY FISHING IS THEREFORE A MUST.
2	i dont even know what u mean
1	because it's important to keep enough fish for all animals to survive.
0	we should care about human impact on nature as we are at fault for its decline
3	there will be no  fish for our furture
4	they shouldn't because they would just be swimming
1	big companes need to recognise that they have the power over and therefore the reponsibility for what they sell
0	we need to individually make a choice tobe more sustainable by only buying the ethical choice
1	a step in the right direction.we also all need to eat more fully plant based meals which are completelysustainable already.every meal does not have to containsomethng from an animal or fish to nourish us fully
1	because morepeoplewill eat less bad food and more good food
1	some people require fish for protein.  important to eat only what you replace
0	i am a vegetarian. We do not NEED to any animals to survive well.
1	it would make us more considerate and less burden
0	I think that this is a good idea because it can help our marine life live for longer.
4	theres no such thing as sustainabl caught fish
0	so much fish gets  wasted as it is. there needs to be a more respectful approach. catches should be less and fishing  companies  should have to help fund fish nurseries that release  fish back into the wild.
0	We share this world with many creatures. The sea is not ours to help ourselves to. We must be mindful when we fish and the impact our fishing has on not only thosewe fish but those that rely on them as this is all linked and disruption of one chain has a continous knock on effect. Fishing and selling of fish should be restricted to the area of seas concerning the stock. Current worldwide selling and distribution of fish has a heavy carbon footprint which is of no benefit to anyone.
0	the oceans could be fishkess by 2050
3	fish like all other food products are already too expensive here only the rich can afford to by.
0	I think that consumers have a big voice in the economy and if we start making more sustainable choices then we can strive to make better choices in all kinds of aspects
4	my friend's host mother is crazy!!!!!!!!!
1	because there would be to many fish in the sea and if one boat leaks it would make all the fish sick
4	because your killing fish that have great lifes
1	i think it will help local fisherman and it would keepour whanau healthy.
3	its killing the fish and if there no fish we will die
1	it envolves a huge amount of money to support those stuff. obvously; we're gonna pay the price. however  mother nature will be supposed to regeneate it self through the years.
1	Supermarkets are only profit driven but if enough people demand sustainable practices in their supplying of fish to customers they may  be forced to listen. It is unlikely but possible.
3	we should  not sell fish because they might get extinct
4	######### is so violent because she is so small
0	i personaly am a vegitarian but i am sure it is better for the enviroment if this happens
0	i dont want bad fish fishy stanky stank fishy
0	stanky fishy stanky fiiisshhhyyyy i got STD MAKES MY COOCHIE ITCH
0	i am a vegitarian but for the people that do eat fish i think i would be a better option
3	seafood is amongst the healthiest foods abd already quite expensive
0	It is only right to do it as good as possibl to be as environment friendly and ethical as possible. It would be even better to just leave them alone and let them live their life as humans have no right whatsoever to just end it.
0	overfishing is wrecking the natral ecosystems in the ocean and is unsustainable in the long term
0	the staet of our oceans deserves our respect
0	the health of our ceans s more inportant than the size of our wallets
1	yessss. this is a great idea
0	Because you can't put a price on a healthy planet. Thankfully younger generations are starting to realize that!
3	this not gonna happen inths system we live in
0	its better fr the animal; enviroment and our bodies.it should be conrolled in very serious way.
0	i believe in changing our human ways. sustainability is important.
1	i worry cost will be a priority oversustainability
1	people should learn to eat local. hopefully we won't need to increase the price so everyone can afford it. better for the planet nd for humans
1	As we becomemore aware we can save the things we takefor granted for our children.
1	because the kiwi fish stocks will end up depleted like the fish stocks in the waters around the Uk!
1	i think  it  is a great idea because fish farms feed the fish unhealthy then we eat it and who knows what whould happen
1	because otherwise we will extinct varieties.
1	fish are becoming unsustainable with current fishing practice

0	food source needs to be sustaniable
0	Food sourced needs to be sustainable

3	because of no  fish more in the future
0	Ii is more important than cost.
1	we  need it to survive water is life
1	its a simple yet effective solution
0	it will revent over fishing and hopefully bringback populations of endagnered species
1	Having more sustainability for all kinds of lifeform on this planet gives future generations the possibiity of living a diverse and colorfull life
4	Fishing in general s unsustainable. If we cotinue to deplete our oceans of its natural inhabitants through over fishing it is predicted that we will see fishless oceans by the year 2050. Animal agrilculture is not sustainable. We mst collectively switch to a plant-based diet if we truly want to preserve ourenvironment and start to undo the damage we have already caused.
1	because its possible this could happen but it could effect alot of people in the sense thatwe wuld be selling it for more money ad lots of people arent millionares!
0	we need to protect our ressources
0	every decision we make in what we eat shouldbeas earth friendly as possible
0	i would hate to see species of fish disappear. by farming fish we ensure a sustainable supply into the future
0	we need to understand how to properly manage and cultivate the planet we live on and not trivialise the danage we are causing our oceans. Id rather fish were entirely banned for a time period than continue with our current system.

0	because we need to look aftr our fish supplies for the future
0	that would be one step closer to saving climate change
0	that wuold be one step closer to saving globel warmings
0	because we are doing a treasure hunt
3	global warming could kill us an make us move to mars
0	because if its not sustainable then we will eventually farm past the point of return. there will be no fish left
0	if its not sustainable we know the practice cannot last. we need be less selfish about our immediat conforts and think of the greater good of our futures and future generations

1	life of fish is just as important as any othe life of a living being
1	Humans are on a path of infinite growth that cannot continue. If we want to continue thriving on this planet we have to change the way we use our precious and finite resources. All living things need our care and respect. We are the Earths guests and not her owner.
0	we have to start considering everything that is  taking this journey with us.  we lose a part of ourselves when we lose a part of our world.  we are all the planet and must look after all of it.

0	we are responsible to protect resources for future generations
1	all in ur enviroent should be managed sothat there is a future inthis industry
1	they should becuse other wise the wont be enough fish in da sea
1	something so simple could have huge benefits for our natural world. if we don't act now it will be too late.
3	people wont want to only have responsibly reared fish atmore cost so may upset the balanceflife
0	i believe in a sustainable fishery in balance with local ecosystems
1	that we can continue to feed ourselves from the ocean without destoying the ecosystem
0	better forhe whole world and not just to the already wealthy western countries and people tht re living there
1	without pressure nothing will change. If there is no possibility to get cheap fish you have to buy sustainable fish and will buy perphaps less.

0	This needs to happen to save the ocean ecosystem
1	it would be great. more fishies
1	because ourfood options should always be sustainable
4	all fish shuld be sustainably caught

1	i think it makes people more aware as they shop and perhaps make a change
1	i wouldlove to be hopeful if ihad kis
2	i dont care because if somoe bullys you i just dont cre
0	sustainability should be  concept embraced by all large corporations and should be more stringently enforced by government
1	WELFARE IS A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN COST
0	there is no other realistic solution with so many hungry people in this over populated planet
0	over fishing is a real issue - go vegan
1	supermarkets should sell sustainably caught fish to minimize the amount that is continually wasted daily. they do not sell out of fish. What percentage is taken from the sea and never consumed?
3	i want to eat more fish
0	so we  have a sustainable future
0	because it will save the planet. there is no planet b
4	supply chain is the most responsable
0	because baby fish will not e caught. which is good.
0	we should pay an honest price for this kibd of food
1	that fish can breed and continue
1	i want  the fish to always be part of our ocean.
1	BECAUSE I want them to still live
0	IF PEOPLE WANT TO CONSUME THE FOOD THEN THEY MUST UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN DO SO BY IMPACTING THE ENVIRONMENT IN AS MINIMAL WAYS AS POSSIBLE THEREFORE PAYING MORE FOR SUSTAINABLE FISHING. THE MORE REALITY PEOPLE KNOW THE EASIER IT WILL BECOME TO TRY AND REDUCE THE PROBLEM.
0	fish caught should be sourced sustainabley beacuse its better longterm. better for the fish population and its habitat. fishermen and consumers will understand the impact their food choices have on the environment.

1	i think that would be more better
1	i think it'd be great to have sustainbly caught fish. it'd be a big step. as the fishing industry can be quite awful.
1	The price would have to go up and people might choose other fish mongers as a result
0	we need to limit fishing sobthers a supply for future geberations to come

3	I believe we should follow vegetarian diets.It would stop the pointless overkilling of fish and animals.
0	if we stop buying cheap fish we will save them for the future
0	BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF FISHES.
0	this stops the risk of accidentally catching dolphins
0	leave something behind for my kids to enjoy
0	sustainable is better! it helps bring back native wildlife and keep the ecosystems in check!
0	It would prevent accidentally catching dolphins  and other  endangered marine life.
0	I  think we should  do this so we can leave something for the next generation like myself.
1	because people are cheapskates and businesses like money
2	I personally don't know its just I have different opinions like it would help to stop endangering NZ marine life but it  would be really really expensive and less less people would be able to afford it or the simplest way is to just stop eating fish.
1	fish meat fruit vegetables all needsto be grown sustainable
0	the fish in the ocean make sure we dont make them the next endangered species
1	We need to be guardians of our resources for future generations. Continual growth and the exploitation of natural resources that goes with it is unsustainable.

1	Fish serve the lwest emissions in production comared to other meats. So we should make it as sustanable as possible.
1	sustainability will always be more important. whats a couple dollars different at te endof the world
0	sustainability is future proofing. if you dont plan the future we die.

2	the store should sell what people want. we need to get people to care and then the store will follow.
1	I think it's an admirable concept but food affordability is still of importance for communities.

1	Overfishing has a huge negative impact on our oceans and the ecosystems within it.
1	the only way to save the planet is by immediate radical actions like this
1	money is the single unifying factor for all. its the only way to make us aware.
4	fish should not be killed eventhough it is labeled as "sustainably caught". This label does not change nor decrease overfishing.
0	your ### go suck s ####

0	save the planet and protecting it too
0	because we need to encorage better practices
0	so that breeding stocks are not damage
1	sustainability means food for the fuure
1	Sustainability is vitally important and hopefully more people realise despite personal cost.
3	i'm worried we won't be able to implement the necessary changes before its too late. unfortunately sustainability is not yet the main criteria people use when buying fish. the price incensitive is still (and understandably) too strong.
0	its the only responsible thing to do
0	the price of food should reflect its true cost
1	it would be nice to share with my kids the same nature that i got to grow up with. Or better! Part of that is having all the same fish life (and food). Without ethical fishing I dont think that will happen.
1	it's important that we do not substantially impact the ecosystems we draw from otherwise there may be no fish left to fish.  i am hopeful that corporations can realize this instead of minimizng costs and maximizing profits which is doubtful
0	because our marine ecosystems are becoming depleted from excessive overharvesting for commercial purposes. so tbh; we dont have a choice.
0	Because the ecosystem will be thriving and in the future the new generation can still get kaimoana for their families
1	Because we will be able to leave some kai moana for the new generation to come. Withtoo many fish beibg taken out of the water there won't be any fish later on for many others to come.
0	before all are extinct and alternative to meat
0	why does it have to cost more? its shortterm thinking to only think about monetary cost when the long term cost is immense
2	## #### told me in a dream
0	money means nothing if we cant sustain the health of our oceans
1	dont eat alot of fish but anything to save the planet
0	that fish are   importent to thecircle of life stoptaken fish out there home
1	i think thisis theway we should goin every aspect of farming. less of it and pay more everythibg in moderation. look after the planet look after u.
0	it is crtcal for species to survive
0	We have to ensure future generations will be able to enjoy this resource also.
0	it could help the earth  survive longer
0	sstainability is the only way to the future
0	fish tastes gross makes me wanna puke
1	i think its important fish is not overcaught but also it needs to be accessible for any to buy
1	i think this is a course ofaction that could really help our delicate marine ecosystems. we need to act now!
0	If its not sustainable we are at risk of causing extinction to mre species
0	because we shuld not be eating non sastainable fish that is not eatable
1	because it feels so much better buyingsomething you know is sustainable
1	we need to save our oceans
0	THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AFTER OUR PLANET
0	Im happy to pay morefor sustainable fish to protect the environment. Supermarkets can afford it.
0	takes the pressure away from consumer choice toact sustainaby
0	id ratherpay more for fish and be able to see them n  the wild
1	it will cost morebut normalising thesethoughts will help people be aware of sustainabiliy constantly.
0	if we want to thrive as humans we need to live sustainablyand within the means of our planet
3	because it would never happen in mylifetime
0	we need to preserve the worlds resources for the future of humanity
0	then most of fish will be happy.
1	everyobe should b e able to buy fish

1	i think i'd rather pay lil bit of extra money to help the environment
0	farmed fish dont even taste that gucci
1	Selling anything these days thats not sustainable is silly. we need to think about the planet
0	sustainable catches of fish are important not only to future proof our fisheries but also o balance comercial recreational bd ecological populations of fish
1	better for environment but may not be possible and cost efficient
0	important to care about our environment and future generations
0	we will have cleaner waters / better knowledge and education around sustainability and responsiblef arming which can knock on to other farming sectors e.g. meat and dairy
4	I think that all types of fishing is bad as most of the pollution in the ocean is discarded fishing gear!!
0	cause the fish must be free
1	probably because that's the sensible optionals dont increae the prices because it will increase popularity in the market reducing financial loss. fucking dweeb.
1	money does not come first. sustainability is priority number one. no matter the cost.
0	It may cost more money; but money isn't the currency we should think of when we talk about our planet and its resources. Putting species in danger becuse of unsustainable actions is a price I rather not pay. Nothig can possibly "cost more" than that.
0	it is a good start for a better and sustainable future
0	the price mechanism of free markets do not account for negative externalities. this asks government intervention. such as regulation and taxation.
1	i think we need to take greater resonsibility for our environmental impact
1	I think it will take time but happen eventually. Will it happen soon enough?
4	it is not economicly viable. plus the prices on fish is already through the roof.
0	NO FISH WOULD BE HURT NEITHER THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. LESS BYCATCH.
1	preserving our fish stocks so that we will have food to last us
4	poor people cant afford should be government subsidesed

1	a step towards living in balance with nature
0	if theydisappear we would be without them
1	it gives hope for the future of these animals
1	it will make unsustainable fishing an unprofitable pursuit and force positive change
1	overfishing is decimating our ocean ecosystems to the point    of no return. action must be taken and supermarkets are giants in the western world and would allow for more widespread involvement. fish should not be taken for granted
0	we need to look after our resources for future generations

1	It is a good first step
1	our world is an amazing place and together with care we can keep it that way

0	this makes people concious about fish consumption
3	we are too greedy to make the changes we need
1	supermarkets and the food industry have a duty to respect the produce they catch/ kill and higher prices  will encourage less waste and more respect towards the food they eat and where it comes from

0	Everyone should do their part to keep the Earth healthy - we all have to  live here
1	i think that we should be doing everything in our power to ensure that we take care of our natural resources. if we only had access to sustainably caught fish then the prices would drop eventually as the different fishery companies competed against each other

1	it s better for te environment
1	so thereare pleanty more fish in the sea forever
4	becuse they dont live a long live
2	um my name is #### and i dont care
4	I believe we should insentivise buying sustainably caught fish and the best way to achieve this is to make it cheaper than the alternative. We have to live here when youre gone Idappreciate a healthy environment
3	even sustainably caught fish still run the risk of being depleted or have consumed plastic. how are we sure that the people running these fish farms arent lying for the btternebt oftheir sakes.
1	beacause people are now starting to care about sustainabilty and the environment

3	eatng fish is unsustainable i worry people will continue eaing as much as they do now.
1	i think sustainabley caught are better because the fish population won't die out
3	because what if the fishes goes extint
0	we need to do sustainable fishing and educate people what that means
0	because we will eat better and live for longer
0	i think fish is good for you
4	i think its mean to catch fish and kill them
1	This will allow future generations to still eat fish and for our oceans to thrive.
2	will not stay sustainable for long if its the only kind available
4	YA DELETED MI WHOLE THING THAT I WOTE.
1	Well... I do like the idea of world friendly fishing... but... it's still a bit bad. Well... fishes could lose their food (the fish caught) and die. And then other marine animals hat eat those fish won't have those fish to eat. And that cycle will repeat.
0	its the future. We are stewrds of this planet.
4	should not sellany fish corpes. veganism is the future.

1	sustainability is the definition of living without such all shal perish
0	if youre going to eat meat then we should be doing it sustainibly. i wantthe option of buying sustainable fish and to know that i am not a part of overfishing and harming fish

0	because our seas are precious and the inhbitants should be protected  from humans greed.i dont mind pying more for any food if it is grown sustainbly. i dont own the planet.
0	because it is very wasteful and highly unsustaibable to continue as we have been going. the slight incease in cost for sustainabe fish severely outweighs the environmentl and social impacts

0	Because from my investigations we either do this or lose what we have  i believe commercial quotas andhow they work and are enacted need close scrutiny andrecreational fishermen should only catch enough for one feed for he family  Both groups should only catch what s needed and I realise that is open to interpretation
1	I think this is a fantastic idea but I feel that supermarkets will not be supportive of this idea as it will cost them more.
0	it gret that i wouldb helpingthe enviroment

2	texas was here 2019 27  novmber
1	would like to see it happen but i doubt big corporations will sacrifice easy profit for the sake of sustainability. some still don't believe it's an issue
1	Beacause overfishing our oceans may lead to extinction of some species. Also overfishing disrupts ecosystem dynamics and systems which can lad to the detriment of other species.
1	as we remember our connection to all we should adjust our practuces accordingly . thinking of te generations to come not just OURSELVES
1	we dont make sustainable choices on our own s mk®ng ®t th? d?f®lt w®ll h?lp

0	that all indigiouns species should beketat a sustainable levlenomatter what the cost
1	it's the only way we are going to preserve our fisheries
0	higher prices encourage less buying and more considertion and sustainability
0	we are overeating  animal protein so make it v expeoosive t
0	we need consumers as well as industries to work together to make fishing sustainable
0	all the seas are overfished and we have to protect them
1	thiswoud have less negitive impact on the ocean ecosystems.
2	we have passed the point of return
0	i cant wait to see the city
0	the human race is doomed.  We shouldnt take away more species before we go.
1	to ensure that biodiversity  is not lost
3	Its just sad to see species go.
0	Its just sad to see another species go.
1	A necessary move but one that will impact those with the least resources the most.
1	it is important to maintain the biodiversty of the ocean. lest we experience massextinction unlike we have ever seen before. the ecosystem is deliate.
0	because it will  save all the fish .
0	we should only take from nature at a justified price
1	hard question. food is already expensive and rise in prices is hard especially on those least fortunate but more needs to be done to help our planet. over fishing is destroying the oceans ecosystems. so i think yes but the government should help offset this cost so the general consumer is not worse off.
3	mwhile i think this is a good idea; there are still alot of people who struggle to afford food. if the prices go up on fish it could mean less people buy it. This could have knock on effects such as less demand on the fishing industry - thus loss of jobs- as a result putting more people into poverty. Overall i think there should be more sustainable products available than unsustainable -but not remove the cheaper options completely.
0	Because it goes along with how nature  already is naturally producing wildlife.
2	that is doesn in jokig boy
0	it is a good idea but i always forget my bags
0	because people are not the only important ones
1	well it has to be sustainable

0	sustainability is the onyl way forward
0	bc first life came from water.. its our roots. we have to keep it safe. sustainibilty means to give next generations same chances than we have now.
0	sustainability is very important you egg  :)
0	cause deb da fish wobtbe smeling as bad
0	i think we are responsibleto our children and generations to come
1	beacuse that means fish can be caught for longer genrations
0	because we need to make eating sustainby easier for consumers
4	because wa make food more expensive?
0	just because is good for environment
1	this would be great if it didn't push up the price of fresh fish!
0	promotes sustinable fishing into the future
2	Personall i am nt fond of fish. However i think its should stay the same. imo
1	Because fish will be able to thrive more and they will last longer for us.
1	because it could be good or bad
1	else we will go exctinct earlier
2	the world is going to end in 50years anyway
4	i  think that the fsh should live a long life and that super markets should just suck it up!save the sea comunity!
4	i think thatsupermarkets cant do that!

1	sustainable fishing is always a good thing!
1	Because it would do wonders in making NZ sustainable and help the fish in our oceans survive longer.
0	I'm a vegetarian and would rather no fish at all but if it has to be sold then sustainable is best
0	ideally no one would eat fish but unfortunately that is rather unrealistic
4	bruhhhhh i aint spending that much the government is taxing us on everything idc
1	we can only save our ocean species if everyones on board
4	i thin i an a retarted sexy motherfuckig dong

3	dont want it to cost more
1	It's a step in the right direction for a sustainable New Zealand!
0	what is  a fish and can i sell it tochildren
0	i think it is important to protect species abd live sustainably. or not eat fish atall.
0	this a good and enviromentaly sustanableiea
4	govenment already taxes us non stop now no ones gonna eat fish lol
0	We could also be helping with pest control by doing so!
1	Because we need to pay attention on what we eat if we want to continue eating it.
1	bc david attenborough showed us how rough it is now. give us fishessss
0	fish are not going to last otherwise.
0	supermarkets only sell a few types              of fish  and they accidently pick up others and waste thosefish
1	I hope that the idea will stick and not get repealed once a crisis hits.
1	We should take care of the world for the future.

1	FISH DESERVE A HEALTHY LIVING ENVIROMENT.  Wait was ca lock on?
0	i think w shoudlook after planet
0	our oceans are overfished and need to recover!
1	Fish are nice. They deserve nice living condisions.
1	also need to consider the market price after this change. but i donot want any species extinct because of human consumption
1	there has to be a change in valuing fish and meat in general. thus everybody should think about their consumption and be aware of the fact that it is still an animal that they are eating.
1	the amout fish in theocean is decreaseingat an alarming rate
0	that they should only catch a maxinum of say 50 fish a day or find a small below 100 amount they can catch per week
1	if we started using only what we need and not catch for megga proffit for the few the world could provide for all
1	when our ocens die so do we
4	this  is cool chnga chonga china man
0	we dont need to endanger wildlife to feed us

0	We all need to do our bit and likely will not change as a society in ourhabits unless we do something like this.
2	i dont care if i get told off because i just dont care.
2	because i dont even mind that fishes get killed and youre suppose to eat them plus i dont even know anything about it.
2	i dont care about fishes getting killed
1	i already buy specific sustainabl fish
1	sadly thisehotake our money have the power to influence
0	we need to think about the future
0	i think that fish are important to our land
0	i think everythING WILL BE OKAY
3	People can cheat others f or money by lyin
4	that #### isnot nice to me
0	overfishing is causes species to die out and big fishing industry causes plastics to be left behind + bicatch :( excited to keep oceans alive!
1	hopefully this will help save the oceans
0	sustainably caught fish will provide more fish in turn and increase longterm yield. it will also promote popultion growth and a healthier ecosystm.
1	we need to keep the fish in the sea
0	need    tokeepthe   fish   in the    sea.
0	Because our back pockets are not the most important things
1	it is a good idea but unsustainable in the market unless nz stops trade and becomes self sufficient
3	I'm worrid that #### ###### will leave the ###### #########
1	Im hopeful that my ##### will grow
0	more fish left for ohers including other fish
1	To make us eat meat or fish as a nice treat not the norm
0	because its  best for the environment
0	because it would be better for the oceansand planet
0	better for the ocean ecosystem and us
0	because we are over farming our oceans and eco systems arebeing ruined
0	if our oceans die we de
0	like all ecosystems the oceans need protection and careful manageent
0	if the bio mass increased in the ocean  we could fish with our childeren and eventually more  fishwould be every where and maybe sustainably caught fish would be more affordable than current fish prices.
0	because if you had to go out and actually catch your fish you wuld think more about how hard it is to fetch enough to survive
0	so there are fishfor the future and protect the oceans
1	it is a must if we want to save our panet!
1	i think i am so crazy
1	if something like this doesn't happen then there will be no fish left to fish and marine ecosystems will be out of balance
1	so we know other sea life isnt also caught in the process. and so we are only taking what we need
2	that i should finish cleaning houses
4	my back hurts call the ambo
1	it will mean we arent killing unneccesarily
1	because it would save fish species from extinction.
0	i think that is a good idea
0	because we all need to be pushing for better solutions
1	use ya brain. dont be a twat
0	THE FISHY STILL TASTES THE SAME AND IT MAKES THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE  THE PROCESS
0	sustainability helps the environment egain what was lost
1	it is important customers can have confidence they are not contibutinng to species decline
3	Were still too late to respond to have a meaningful and sustainable impact. ):
3	I LOVE THE FISH TOO MUCH
0	I am ##### and I don't like eating the poor fish.
1	it is a god idea in the long run but personally i dont feel like the prics should be raised too high
1	then we will be one step closer to a better world
1	it means we will retain a vast variety of fish species
1	ITS IMPORTANT TO RESPECT OTHER LIVING ESPECES
0	Producers and large corporates need to lead the way in order for change to happen fast enough. People may buy less fish as a result but that would be more sustainable. Eating fish is not a necessity for optimal health and is not worth its environmental impact. Keep it in the sea!!
2	well im a vegitarin and in genral dont like fish

0	dont  worry ### ####### is going to die tha bad fishy and be baldis
4	### ####### will be baldy and big fishys die
0	makes it simpler to buy sustainable
3	good idea to sell sustainably caught fish but bad idea to sell at a high price because not everyone will be able to afford it. it can lead to other problems like health issues and illegal activity eg illegal fishing
1	the idea is very good and important but the reality and human nature are more complex and cruel.
1	stop eating meat altogether. if you must; be sustainble
0	Its in the name really sustainable means for a better future
2	because there is lots of  kind we are using
0	so ll of the other fish species can be happy!!!!!!
1	it is good for the enviroment
1	we have a responsibility as consumers to make sustainable choices but those that sell should alsosupport us to make wise choices

0	saving our biodiversity should not be optional
0	because its better for the sea
0	it is better for the sea
0	people should  take care of their own body - nutrition - consequence: nature will be safe

0	over fishing is killing the planet
0	resourceful ness is key to sustainability
0	itsgood to think sustainable and set rules to limit over fshing. seafoodshould costmore. it should be a treat.
0	we should be more concerned about sustainability thancost.supermarkets should be more worried about protectig our environment than lining the pockets of their share holders
2	I don't care because I don't care
1	because consumers would backlashand and poor peoplewould be affected
0	We should be protecting our ocean life because otherwise future generations wont be able to enjoy it and once its gone we cant get it back
0	according to all known laws of aviation. bees should be unable to fly. their short wings shouldnt be ableto get their fat ittle bodies off the ground
0	it is important that we dont over  fish otherwise we will have no fish left! sustainable fishing is the only way forward!
0	because overfishing equals extinction of diversity
3	it cost more and causibg more poverty
1	we need to leave our children a better world and this would be small step in the right direction

0	i think ###### is a good frined
3	all fish ing should be sustainable

0	it wouldnt hurt the fishs ecosystem. fish raise in captivity would be better for the environment.
1	because thay can do do hatthay won' t
2	thay can do what thay wont
1	it would be a step foward in preserving nature but would have to beapplied in simiar ways to other meats
1	let the tasty fish thrive so that we can eat more
1	so that we keep many species of fish and soour ocean life is kept sustained and gorgeous !!
1	people are starting to care and the market is starting to respond
1	it should be a no brainer really.
0	this should help go with keeping our fish population abundant
0	Fishing can be a sustainable foodsource with a strong feed to produced output ratio.
0	all our food should be more sustinable
0	good but i worry that people wont like greater cost

0	.Overfishing is disrupting the natural dynamic equiibrium of the ocean on a biome level. Negatively affects food chains and food webs globally for marine creatures. Sustainable fishing would allow marine populations to thrive once again. This would ensure certain species would not become extinct.

0	It wise and worth the cost long term. Extinction is a greater price to pay.
1	we can be wiser and far more sustainble with what we catch and consume. go for what is high in resource rather than low in resource and high demand. At the end of the day we are consumer and will eat/use what we are provided.
3	i dont know really but i threw up 4 times cuz of fish

1	this will ensure a fish supply for our descendants
1	i think it is a great idea because it is cheaper but the same
0	there is no longer justification for unsustainableagriculture. we need t shift asap

1	this will make sure our grandchildren can eat fish
1	id like to know fish will remain in sufficient numbers to feed us and not disappear species by species
1	it should just be the norm
1	itshowwe can maintain an ocean ecosystem

0	we have to stop destroying our biodiversity and have to protect the  fragil balance of the planet by keeping this biodiversity.

0	Fish is too unsustainably caught. Too many non targeted species are all caught.

1	i think that it is important for us to value what we have andnot take it for granted. It will be better for the fish and our ecosystem.
1	i think this is better for the enivronment and will allow us to have more fish in the future even if we may notbe abe to afford  it all the time.
1	we should not eat meat. it is killing the earth and the animals
1	I think that fishing in NZ needs to be more ethical
0	Because the world and our human society is at a point where we need sustainable and renewable practises everywhere in order to survive. This includes agriculture and energy and transport as well as product developement and construction. Everything we do needs to adapt because the world is changing and we need to change with it.

1	if we dont slow down fish consumption soon we face a future of dead desolate oceans
0	we ony have one earth and need to do whatwe can to make it and its creatures  last
3	Stopping consumption of fish altogether is the only viable solution
3	Why catch and eat fish at all when we could eat foods that we don't need to kill? Let's leave the ocean alone!
1	wildlife also fish is so important to rescue
1	due to overfishing being a looming issue it would increase the number of marine wildlife for the next  generation

1	i hope strict regulations can make sure that fish are actually being sustainably caught.
0	humanty needsto begin thinking morelongterm and sometimes itsan important tradeoff we needto make to live more sustainably
0	we need to live within natures boundaries. a small cost now prevents a big cost later.
1	although its not likely it happening would be extremely benificial for the environment
0	its the responsible thing to do
0	i think that the suermarkets should only sell sustainable fish as if this continued overfishing will leave future generations fishless. to ee the fuits of your loins dont overfish
0	Its a great idea we would totally support
0	its important to avoid over fishing in our seas and  to prevent unnecessary sealife being caught
1	A big step in the right direction
0	because we can save fish for future
0	we need to take better careof our bodies and our ceans
0	then we dont hve to kill fish that have nt done nything to us; and they dont become extint

0	becouse if thay do not thay will not beadil to have enough timeto bread so thay can not have any babys
0	to keep them for the future
0	Because fish are going extinct as well as other animals. Our unhealthy fishing ways need to change. They need to become safer and more sustainable
1	so we have a much biggr population of fish but thatis not very likely.
0	i think because it will help reserve the native fish and im excited for it to maybe be added to retail rues
0	because we need to protect other species
1	it is  bacause i do not want to have a filling
0	because the fishing industry has been overfishing and we are losing our resurces
0	i think it would provide environmentally friendly fish  farming. it can also preserve fish from extinction.
0	we need to embrace the concepts of sustainability more and more for our futures and the futures of animal and plant life. Shops need to engage in buying and providing resources that are sustainale for the Earth.
0	to protect the wild fish stocks
1	cause then weknow they arent killing fish that dont need to be killed yet.
1	i hope we will all push for it. but food is already expensive
0	if we unsustainably fish not only doour fish die but our othermarine life does too
0	ifwe run out you cant buy any. simple maths. it is infuriating to see new zealand let so many animals become extinct
1	The oceans are being fished dry. Fish are going to be raised in priced eventually due to scarcity. We will not be able to buy any if they are extinct.
1	we what fish to last a long time
0	peoplebshould hav access to fresh fish to eat
1	stopping overfishing and fish farms allows for a natural cycle of life. ensuring fish is sustainably cought encourages fishpopulations to rise
1	People should be able to eat what they like but it has to be sustainable so we can still have the option in the future. The cost does not matter to me as it is more important for everything to be sustainable.
1	It would help nature a lot
0	yes it would make it easy to shop if all brands sold weresustainable
1	to prevent overfishing around new zealand before it may be too late
0	we need to look after our fish stocks before they run out.

4	i dont like them they are boring
3	i feelthat we take to much and dontgive enough back
3	they should leave fish alone they wont to live there lives like us they should not sell fish any more
3	i feel for future generations there maybe a shortage and very few species of edible fish left. over years we have been bound by thought more is better. Greed will be the ruin of our future fish numbers. We should take action now in providing appropriate fish farming and fix set quota to prevent waste and future numbers for our future generations
1	Altough sustainably caught fish may cost more it will benefit society in the long run
0	so that overfishing is prevented and thus ecosystems are protected
1	I hope lives can be spared in this process.
1	action today can help with the future
1	im hopeful for cultural shifts. Then people will see the importance of preserving resources for the futre.
1	resonsible and sustainable fishing is our priority
0	we need them so the oceans will survive
1	Because if we hope to survive as a species we need to change the way we interact with the world around us. When everything is dead and extinct - only then will people realise you cannot eat money.

1	that is probably he only way for sustainability
0	cuz its good fr da fish
0	it is better for the environment to not be importing fish
1	as the only option- humans would be forced to help the planet
0	i believe that the pubic eyeis shaped by what is supplied. if there is no possibilty of eating imported fish society willfall into place. importing fish is not sustainable. we should be content with what we have.
1	its the right thing to do. but it is difficult to change my habbits by myself.

1	thenumbers of wild fish woud grow
1	it is time to top plundering our in danger  resources
0	my grandchildren also want to eat fish
1	For me it's pure logic. I prefer pay more now for good an healthy food than pay the heavy price of not having food anymore in the future.
3	This may cause people and families with lower incomes become unable to afford sustainably caught fish. They may turn to purchasing other environmentaly damaging or unhealthy food sold at a cheaper price.
2	i like big fishis because theyquench my unwnding hunger with their dilicious vitiman c
0	will help fish populations to recover

0	i think it is better for the environment
2	because i do not get what to do but i know i will like it in the end
0	i think this will be fun to do
0	because then the fish can have a chance. if you dont catch it yourself with a fishing rod then you dont eat it.
0	its the right thing to do because its sustainable
4	No animal should be killed by us. If we can thrive without killing anybody then why shouldnt we?
1	I do not mind paying more for sustainable caught fish
1	i think it is muh better
1	lets take ownership and responsibility for this creation as God intended
1	good for fish and the sea
0	its kinder and better for the ocean
0	i think it will encourage people toeat less animal protein and discover more nonmeat sources
0	it is imperative to preserve our stocksof fish
1	it might save people from getting sick from long lasting chemicals.
3	i think at the rapid rates we are depleting our resources we should stop raping our oceans ban fishing trawling all togeter and pray that we will beable to make a difference in time
1	i think hopeful because fish are amazing and should be looked after
4	because it is  getting worse when New Zealand has problams
1	it would be better for the enviroment but we would have to pay more.
1	what do u call a fish with no eyes? a fsh
4	becuase you are ruining the enviroment
0	overfishing became a rising problem.it is our responsability as either businesses;  citizens; consumers to consume better and heathier to ensure a bright future for our planet and children.
3	because the whole populaion of fish in newzealand will start to fade away and we have a lot of beatuful fish that are very specail to new zealnd
0	its fun to know how much fish there are. and have fun looking at them.
2	i am a noob i dont care about fish (im totally a noob)
1	hopeful because we can save the environment
1	i think hopeful because we can save the environment
0	i dontwantmy fishto be caught by slavery. capitalism destroys thefish stocks and the humansthatare unfortunate eough to workfor them
3	I feel worried that no fish eating may be sustainable since displacing demand from one fish for another may only shift the challenge...
1	I think we all should try to think more about what we eat and shouldhave more respect for animals
1	it will help recover species by reducing harvesting.
1	all the products should be sustainable!
0	First step in being able to eat sustainably
1	bruh suck my fat juicy ####
0	because its good for the fish
0	it is the right thing to do
1	how can you tell the flaver of fish
1	because otherwise there wont be any fish left in th future
1	i think its a great start
2	i dont really mind because im vegetairian
1	its good to keep rare speceis of fish inthe water so you can you can keepthem going and you should do what you can even if the prices higher
3	Fisherman need to provide for their families its a compicated issue and is there really such a thing as sustainable fishing or is it just a contradiction?
0	shoud start now before its too late  keep the sea alive
0	better to be cautious thenfish stocks plummet
1	I  think that if the fish is caught sustainably it will allow us to know how many fish there are and wether their numbers are growing. And will allow nature to grow in many ways
1	i think they should as soon as possible to let other species recover.
0	more   fishes  are given  the chance to thrive and reproduce. which means more fish for the future  generations.
3	I THINK THERE SHOULD BE TRACEABILITY OF THE CAUGHT FISH. THIS WILL MEAN DATA WHICH COULD HELP ENSURE A SUSTAINABLE QUANTITY OF FISHING TAKES PLACE
1	if not then fish stocks will be completely depleted
1	We need to act now. Laws and rules like this are needed to make people realize and force the fishing industry to change their methods and become as sustainable as possible. It is not too late yet.
0	preserving this benifical for our future generations is inportant
0	we need to take care of our food sources or we wont have any.
1	i think people need to do better.
1	we wouldnt knw exactly how they get thm on our end wheb we acyally consume them.it is up to the big coorporations that will ensure it comes through
1	i think its important to protect endangered species.
0	IT MAKES METHINKOF EATING FISH :D
1	i love eating fish but i like knowing theyre thriving too.
0	fish are delish but we cant eatthem all

3	not all will be able to afford
4	bc we wode still kill the fish
1	uncle is the son of grandma
0	we have the ability to farm animals for food.why kill wildlife if wedo not need to.it mucks up the balance of the ecosystem
1	it will eventually but italways takes a while to educate consumers about value vs worth then to change current understanding and behaviors into the new norm.
0	We should be actively seeking change for the better.
0	because itis good for the environment
0	because all of our generations will be able to eat fish and it is delicious and really good for you also without fish the sea will not be very healthy!!
3	it would be great but how will this affect people in poverty
1	so we can have a more better future
0	because fish are friends not food
0	if its not sustainable there is no future
0	The sea is overfished and certain species will be extinct if we do not act.
1	i think this  will make a changeto our environment  and save fishes
4	they should be able to live
1	your response scale is problematic. people will be confused about what responding to. supermarkets or environmental issue. might account for your equivocal findings which not helpful if want to make use of normative influence. tryan agree to disagree scal.
1	It is good for the enviroment
1	we should do this as then we can have the delicious fish for longer.
1	our oceans are vital so overfishig might futuristically be a big problem
1	because it is good for our community

1	unsustainable practices harm people and planet
0	Sustainability should be seen as a change in our lifestyle - not a reaction once ecosystems are destroyed or fish stocks completed. The momentary monetary gain of few brings no value to the lifetime liveability of many.
1	It's either that or people can watch the fish get more expensive anyway as atocks dwindle and/or disappear.
0	Helps protect wildlife and decreases the demand of fish meaning numbers can increase more rapidly.

4	Because we are ruining our beautiful Earth!!:(
0	NZ IS THE BEST PLACE EVER SO IS ENGLAND

1	IT HELPS THE EARTH BECAUSE USING UNSUSTAINABLE FISH LEADS TO OVERFISHING
0	I think it is exited because it is good for Earth.
0	If we dont start sustainablly catching fish now we wont have ANY in the future u could think of it like 5 trees if you cut down one and grow three then you can get would from the source and still get more wood but if you down 4 and planted your would keep decreasing until you have none left.
0	because we should be letting the fish stocks and oceans recover
0	we should respect earths resources & ensure we use them sustaiably -  reduce/  reuse/ recycle
1	I believe beibg hopeful is an even higher level than beibg excited. I hope that supermarkets do this. Even though I don't live in New Zealnd Iam from New Zealnd.Ibelieve that that's more important than just living there. I'm not just saying this because I am "hopeful". I'm sayibg this because I care

1	We should take care of the other animals that also live here andnot encourage unsustainable actions.
1	I  think deepsea animals should be eaten.
4	because deep sea animals shoud be aten
1	so our fish species dont become extinct
1	we think this is a very good idea and should be used in the futre. it would make the futre better and a better enviroment to live in because we would not have gulit that we are hurting the fish.
0	it is a smart decision to protect fish stocks and the fishing industry for the longer term
1	because it stops fish being endangered
2	depends on how the process is executed
0	it will contribute to a better environment
2	because all most fish hve large reproductive amount like 10-20 per fish
0	its the only resposible way to protect nature

0	because we have to sustain species and takewhatever is necessary andno more
2	As long as the prices dont go up significantly imok with the system
0	we need to adjust what and the amount of food we eat.
1	to balance the ecosystem mother of nature
2	the nature has its own way to process the change. eating sustainably fish wont change much to the nature. fishing control is good enough for the fish. the faults are from thosedont follow the rules. punishment should be more to scare them to making profit from the fish. also stop using single use plastic to save the ocean save the fish and save the planer
4	i think our nation is big enough to sustain our growing population
1	this world needs saving and this is one of the many ways to help
0	because we should care forth planet

0	because you get fresh fish because its more fresh
0	i think that fish still have lives and should be caught in a respectable fashion
1	As the Species on the very top of the foodchain its our responsibility to make sure all Nature and Animals stay protected and cared for!
1	Beacause that way it is better for the environment
0	Because it doesn't ruin sea life cycles
1	i think it will work well with shoppers and supermarkets
1	it would be better for the rare fish speices
1	i think that it will definitely be better for the sealife in our oceans so i am hopeful that it will make a difference
1	nz is a good country so we can do it!
1	peole wont stop eating them so it should be made sustainable
4	fish are friends not food. why should we eat them at all.
4	The Vegan movement has grown to include over a hundred million people around the world leaving fish (and ALL animals) off of our plates and out of our mouths and tummies. Join us already. End the cruelty. Stop paying for the death of our fish and our ocean alike.
4	how is it sustainable to continue eating fish if we are wanting to save them? fish are not existing for our disgusting consumption of them. leave the fish in the oceans where they belong and go vegan!
4	angry  because they should do this already
1	we need to protect mother earth

0	it is better because it is more helthey
0	I personaly think thatfood shoud costmoethan it does because of the obesityand stuff like that. And it would be great for the nature as well. We don't need to eat meat everyday. It's not healthy even for us. And we killed so many species already so why do it with another? Peace
0	to help keep a sustainable levelof fish for the future
3	It is worrying that poorer families may not be able to supplement their diet with fish. Corporate fisheries should pay for sustainable fishing from their budget.
0	we can't go on fishing the way we are - species are dying out
1	we are fudging upthe world with our greed
0	dont want to run out of them

4	dad is going to the shop
0	MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT THE PLANET
0	because then we know who to support in the fish industry
1	it should be done. supermarkets have the choice to cutinto their profits for the good of th next generation and not only make business decisions that put pennies in their shareholders pocketsn ow
0	better to have live fish than hve torely on artificial food later
1	with the amunt of people in the world the only sustainable way to fish is farming.this is bad.
3	not everyone can afford theprice tag increase
3	It will reduce the number of fish in the ocean
3	without any goverment regulation there will be done as much damage as possible  as long there is some profit to get

1	stop taking and start giving bck
0	strict regulations not only prevent consumption of unsubstainable seafoods but also raise awareness.
0	BECAUSE TOO MANY IMPORTANT SPECIES ARE BEING WIPED OUT ANDDESTROYING THE FOODCHAIN
1	i think its because fish will go extinct
3	fish are liveing things just like us we should not catch them
1	sustainabe method  is better for the   longer term survival of sea life. its mutually beneficial to humans ad sea life
1	sustainabily caught fish woud mean that  in the future there will be fish left for our chidren
0	i am young and i want to be able toeatfish when i am old too
3	itis sad for our fish populations
1	it affacte our ecosystems and helps us be accountable for what we consume
3	This will only work through legislation rather than a long term economic outlook from supermarkets and those who harvest fish.
3	I very much doubt that customer pressure would be sufficient to ensure sustainable sources only are used. Additionaly what adout pet food fertilisers etc?
1	more attention should be paid to where our food comes from and how it is produced as well as what we export and where we export to.
0	i love fish. on my chips and in the sea. and i want my grandchildren to enjoy them too.
0	There is a delicate balance between all things. We need to protect what we have -and enjoy- by sustainably sourcing everything. We have lost so many species already (birds food animals plants trees etc) and it's very sad. Everything is connected and everything is affected by us. We get to choose if we will have a positive or negative impact. Choose good for the long term. We don't need to be selfish money making machines.

1	right and smart thing to do
1	hopeful that we begin to realize that having a sustainable environment is worth something
1	i dont know how this will help
0	we need to save our natural resourcesor we wont have any food for the future
1	This would help us make better choices considering most of us are not educated in threatened species
1	new zeland has lot of wildlife sancturies so we can sell sustainably caught fish
1	This s a ood idea because it is cool.
0	because it wouldn cause too much harm
0	we ave to balance the fishsupplies to avid extinction of certain species

1	i would pay more to know thefood i an buying has been sustainably fished for me and future generations.
1	long term this needs to happen
1	i worry that most people's standard f living doesn't support buying expensive food .perhaps  a govt subsidy would help?
0	It is a great idea. It is one way to give back to the enviroment.
0	We should keep our nz fish in large numbers. This is the first step
0	We should keep our nz fish in large numbers. This is the first step
1	i am hopfell that it will work
0	because it is good for our oceans and environment and our bodies
1	Sustainable is likely to end up meaning farmed.  Farmed means dubious health pollutants and contaminents especially if they are fed food waste....
0	we need to be more mindful fwhat we eat
3	i think fish should be able to survive because otherwise the ocean will never be the same
0	the cost of preserving nature ethically outweighs an hours wage or money

4	angry because fish deserve to live
4	That we dot get KFC evrynight
1	BECAUSE THE FISH WILL LOSE THEIR HABITAT
1	more fish will survive and have babies and make more  fish
1	if people are only selling sustanible fish then that means that the other fish that could go extinct won't be caught as much so they might still have a chance but enventually they will have to stop because then the fish that they are catching might go extinct because they are being caught so much.
1	so fish do not go endngered or exinct.
0	we are fishing out our oceans
0	so that my childrens children will be able to eat fish and know how to be sustainable
0	more equal balences in the ocean for life forms to be sustained
0	i think its a good idea. people will probably end up heathier and if it helps our environment then who cares about the cost
1	because it will stop oceans from being so scarce of sea life.
0	ths will be better for our future in the lng run to help our enviroment and save planet
0	I think its fair and better for our future for  the long run
4	we should not eat fish or any other animal
4	So you guys won t use plastic bags to save the fish but you guys won t stop  eating fish to save the fish!?

1	je pense qu'il ne faut pecher que dans les stocks renouvelables.
1	Je pense  que l on arretera de pecher des  especes menacees d extinction
1	there seems to be a generational shift in peoples thinking and consumption habits. Therefore i have more in the younger generation rather than supermarkets taking the lead.
1	that it will help the ocean wildlife a lt and we wont eat as much fish because it is more expensive.
1	I think that this would help the overfishing problem and stop more fish from going extinct.
1	The other option is total extinction for ourchildren. How is that a hard choice?
3	people will be turned away from fish
0	only way to save ocen substainnabiity
1	nowadays earth is currently under risk.  if you want to eat fish you need to pay it the real cost. you get used to eat fish for on dollar nevertheless it is not the fair price. so consume less but consume better
0	because everyone should eat healthy fish. seafood is expensive already and they should make the seafood match the money. also since global warming is getting worse it could help the enviroment
1	i think hopeful because i want it to happen
0	i can always cheer my friends up and play fun games

0	sustainably produced food is not just the future but need actions already today
1	I reckon we need to start making changes around this topic specifically
3	we have too many people globally.there will not be enough fish for everyne so it means that only rich children get to eat fish and other proteins
0	it would cost less in the longterm and leave some for the next generation
1	awareness of the masses is key
1	I reckon we should start working around this topic
0	capitalism is supremely flawed and hell bent on destroying our natural world.
0	we should all*be excited about everyone helping to change  past behaviour.
1	i wish enough people cared. we have to start somewhere. demand better for our earth.
1	WE SHOULD DO IT BECAUSE WE NEED TO HELP THE ENVIROMENT AND SUPPORT THE CRETURS WHO LIVE IN IT
1	we need to keep the diverse species of fish for future generations
1	if we all care then we can impact change
0	i want to keep eating fish in the future

0	because they  are a part of our ecosystem
1	it is important to undrstabd where our food comes  from so we need knowledge and labels on food
1	because it won't keep the balance of the worl
0	because we should all be treated the same
0	because  sea life can live longer
2	i think we are to many
1	we can do it if we care
0	so we dont harm the marine ecosystem
0	because some fish that  breed slowly will become extinct
1	While NZ inceasibg its sustainability does not solve the problem of overfishing and a global failure to be sustainabe in relation to our commercial ocean activities it does mean that NZ is more aware of the disasterous effect of overfishing and can combat it on a slightly larger scale.
1	depends n human response.  are we all that interested
1	gotta think about what our kids and their kids are going to eat too.
1	sowehave more food in the future

0	i think it is very good to protect the enviroment
0	fish stocks are being depeted  we should minimise our consumption of fish
4	No fish should be caught - the stocks are depleted as well as many other marine species. We don't need fish in our modern diet to survive!!
0	i think thats the way we have to go to keep all the natural balances
0	FISH ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM
1	we need to protect biodiversity in the future
1	FISH THAT IS CAUGHT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO WHERE IT IS SOLD IS FRESHER AND COULD BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN IF WE TOOK SUSTAINABILITY INTO CONSIDERATION
1	i think everything we do is sustainable.
0	save our fish stock for the future
0	we  want to have as good a life now as the generations that follow us and save the human species only habtiat as we know it .
3	worried that they wont andwill wake up too late
1	The environment is becoming a priority and Im hopeful that we as a country will come to the understanding that resources are a priviledge not an entitlement
3	i am worried about  are world
1	It is not to late to chane and make the world a bit better
2	i do not want to tell yous
3	hello im ### looking for hot girl
1	i thin it could help the planet.it would be great

1	because if we take all the big fish the fish won't be able to have babys and the fish will be extinct
0	if we take all the fish they cannot replace thenselves  quick enough. Humans need to reduce their consumption.
0	catching fish is just WRONG.how would you like to be a fish? thats my question. i feel sorry for those poor fish. we shoud not catch fish any more.
1	I think people are realizing we need to change our ways if we areto have hope for a sustainable future. My hope is supermarkets will adapt and lead the way for this change.
1	we should know where our food is coming from .
1	that everybody should not eat meat
0	you have got to  do the right thing for the planet
4	sustainability is a luxury of the rich.
1	supermrkets have an obligation to help controlconsumer behaviour and notjust considerprofit
2	commercial fishing should be limited to outside the 12 mile exclusion zone
1	we have to look after the stocks
0	because we have to look after our fish
0	im exited because if we start doing his more and more then it will help the fish and the enviromentand a better future!
0	the future depends on the sustainability we practice today
0	because it helps the oceans ecsystems recover ensuring natural sustainability
0	nature first . we need to respect and not plunder.
2	Aquaculture is becoming more efficent and has already replaced wild catch as the primary producer of seafood in the world
0	Ko te moana te pataka kai mo aku mokopuna
2	it bad i like fish but it will cost merei have nok munny
0	because over fishing is bad for the environment
0	oceans are our lifeline. we need to protect them
0	it is not a necessity to eat fish. make all luxuriess ustainable.
0	I Think it willbe good because people wont over fish and if you  over fish seals will die and if seals die sharks will die than all of us will die becase we wont have enough food
0	cuz i am at te papa
0	i think fish are supposed to be in the sea and if this is nt possible we should hunt fish without killing other animals like turtles or dolphines by fishing
3	shoudnt be paying top dollar for nz caughtexpprt
0	because thats gang shit savg the planet
1	cant eat fish if there arent any left
0	there wont be anymore fish in the ocans by2050 iff we sont catch them sustainably
1	Being sustainable doesnt need to reflect the cost. Where there is nessesity there is inovation.
1	that it is good because we are helping the world
0	i think it is a good idea because the fish species will not go extinct
0	i think it is a great idea
0	as a species we have no right to wipe out another species of life
1	i think it is good because it is good for the nature
0	because it is better for the people and enviroment and the fishies
0	Id prefer to know people who do eat fish are helping the planet. I dont eat it personally coz I think the best way to help is to leave the fish be.
1	i think more legislation is needed to make this a reaity
0	becase I get toseethe different kind of reptiles
0	because even if it cost moremoney it can also prevent people from deceases tht spread throghtout the worrld...............it is lso good if the supermarket have itfresh to attract more customers
1	we are over fishing to much
1	it will help to prevent global warming
1	SOMETIMES IMPORTANT CHANGES DO NEED A (partially) UNWANTED PUSH TO GET THROUGH.
0	we should take more responsibility of the treasures of nature. organic fairtrads and sustainability HAVE to be STANDARD.
1	encourages the industry to implement sustainable practices
0	think 100 years from now. i want my children to enjoy fish too.
1	because it is better for our planetabd the animals
1	let's take responsibility for our actions and our future
0	ITS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT OUR MARINE LIFE
0	I think if people can't make the change for the betterment of the planet themselves then the choice should be made for them.
1	i think it woud help sustain an ecological balance in our enviroment maintaining a biodiverse culture in that ecosystem
0	Sustainable fish preserve these and other secies for future generations and maintain healthy ecosystems. They are worth the temporary personal expense.
4	no fish should be harvested. fish should only be recreationally caught
0	i love exploring new things and places
1	biodiversity is more important than cuisine
0	we should only eat what is sustainable but we need to ensure it is affordable for all!
0	food has to be priced for its proper value. if not sustainable future generations will go without
2	im okay with almost anything as long as i have enough
1	we are becoming more aware and caring
0	because without careful attention fish become scarce and we ruin wildlife as well as livlihoods.
1	education of new generations can make the difference. We need to think of the impact of our actions and how we impact our resourses
0	it is better for our planet
1	to ensure a healthy ecosystem flourishes in the oceans
3	the price of fish will be by far more expensive for people to actually purchase this will cause some people to not be able to afford eating fish...
0	sustainably caught fish means that future generations can enjoy it too and it is reliably sourced
2	because you dont need to pay
0	so fish can live longer and hopfullystay alive for ever
4	we are the greatest country for feeding the restof the world yet locally we pay twice as much...which is absolutely wrong
1	fish populations will be able to recove after yers of over fishing
1	great for the lads to catch a fish!!!!!
1	great for the lads to catch a fish even if the are manaskuz
0	great for thelads to catch afish even if theyare mana skuz
1	I think its a good idea but if it happens they should sell it for cheaper otherwise  people won't buy it. Whats the point in making a change if people aren't going to buy it?
0	cause my sister is in the earthquake house
3	supermarkets will do it for commercial reasons and not for the good of nature and simply make us pay more for sustainable fish produce
1	totally makes sense. from those who can to those in need
0	act now before we lose breeding stock and undermine the future of native species
0	most fishing today is still lowering stocks. that is not sustainable
0	je penseque les poissons on le droit d avoir une belle vie
0	bcause overfishing is a big problem
2	because i'm ##  and i don't like fish anyway
1	over demand creates un supportable oceanic ecosystems
1	I believe our lives are intertwined with the sea. We should therefore treat sea life with respect and not take it for granted.
3	Though the sustainability of fish farms is unclear unless the demand for fish drops or the price for it drastically increases I am skeptical of its steady state status. Overfishing is already a very real thing
0	sustainability is theonly way to guarantee thefuture
1	nz is showing theworl by example
1	fishiries must be managed and preserved in order to preserve our future
0	this is a very good idea
0	there isnt always time to make informed decsions while shopping. only selling sustainable takes away the risk of buying potentially environmentally damaging products and will increase the competativeness of sustainable product pricing.
0	i just ant to know why
0	sustainabiity is important fo a growing population
0	its important to preserve  our oceans and their inhabitants for future generations
3	. bcause alins my distroy the planet
1	sounds good but i dont like fish
0	Supermarkets are always forced to make  a choice about which products to stock based on a number of different considerations. Governments should provide financial incentives to ensure that more than just the profit margin is considered.
0	Keep fish stocks for the future
0	This is essential so there is fish for the future generations.
0	we need to do something to make a difference
1	because GOD is the king of cretion and he will give and take and provide for us His people who trust him.
1	it is better for the enviroment
0	im excited because times ae changingand this will be a sustainable cange
0	i think that then the fish species wont die so easily
2	i honestly don't care   btw i'm ##with a # year old child
2	i think i need to ###
0	we need to respect our environment and make sure its kept for our grandchildrens children
0	it will the help our ecosystems recover faster and our future generations will benefit as they will have a sustainable food source to eat from.
1	fishshould only be caught sustainably. otherwise the ocean eco system will be damaged to the pointof no return
1	a thriving healthy oceanic ecosystem ensures a thriving healthy world
0	it would keep thefish at a good steedy number and it may also get people out fishing with there family more going back to the good old days would be good
0	He whakaaro tika t?n?i. Ahakoa te mahi uaua me mahi p?nei ttou hei whakatinana te whakaaro nei ki te ao.
0	we have to make sacrifices tosave our planet
1	Iwould be willing to pay more for a healthier planet
0	because it is intersting and fun at the same time
1	we should be accuntable. bear the true costs for our wants
0	sources are limited and becoming smaller
1	I hope that the scientists are heard clearly above all the noise of big business and corrupt politicians.
1	that its brilliant cause then our anceters have kaimoana
0	i feel like humanity isnt giving ther species a chance. weshouldbe te changethat th world wants tosee
2	i am cool give me money
1	as  it will increase sealife by alot
1	it would be bad to runout of some varieties
1	i couldnt agree more. although i am bit concerned as some people actually voted that they dont care. sad
1	it is the right thing to do
1	it is good for the future
0	WE NEED TO HELP THE BIRDS
1	because is is important to ave the fish
1	i want to help the birds
1	my freind from whangarei comes over to greytown with us
2	i dont care about fish sorry
0	we have tolook afterour kaimoana much better than we have to date
1	this could be a crucial step in making nzs economy more sustainable but it needs to happen now
1	its just what we should be doing in everything we buy and sell
0	great for the lads to catch a fish not thesupermarket lads
0	becuase it's good for the environment
1	a ecosystem should remain in balance and this is a good step towards that
0	that this is an amazing idea
1	because the some of will get hurt even if the fish cost les or more they sould be caught in a more eco friendly way :)
1	Cos it is less violence for the fish and  better for them.
1	cause we should put the environment first
3	Sustainabillity is important but so is affordable healthy food.
0	there are not enough fish to maintain current population requirements
3	WORRIED ABOUT POORER PEOPLE WHO WONT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT
1	i think it would be good
3	I can not afford to buy that  again.
0	we should be protecting our sealife
0	I'm excited because here I'm learning about nature.
3	i am worrie that we will not have enough and i won't be able tp afford
0	its the way forward. we wll have no fish left in the future if we do not do this
1	i kinda like fush and chups
0	I WOULDNT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT BUYING FISH WOORRYING ABOUT THE WAY ITS BEEN CAUGHT AND WHAT WENT TO WASTE
1	no fishing farms that are polluting sea and rivers
1	I don't know much about it but it sounds like it could be a great idea
0	sustainable can only begood for all
0	Save the seas for tge future
0	money dosnt matter the earth does
1	we need to protect the ecology
1	the likelihood of sustainable nfish often is overcome by companies desire for profit
0	we have to take care of  the oceans
0	beacause it issaving the planet and helping the fish survive
0	we can sustain our best fish and keep fish for our grandchildrens childres
1	More resekt for the ozean and the animals in it. Tolerance for liveand creatuares.
1	In my pointof view - Its very good when everybody is a part of saving fish and by that a part of nature :)
1	i work in fisheries and sustaining our resorce whie creating more value from our current catch is important to all
3	because da chippy will cost more uce
0	i love fish and love to go swimming with them that is why i am worried about them being caughtso i think it is a  very good idea to save all the fish that arecaught
3	WOULD BE BETTER IF WE GO VEGAN
1	cause that means humans are not all bad
0	i think that New Zealand is leadig theworldin sustainable practices and it is amazing to see
0	we need to care for all life.
1	this way there wil l be more food abd less extnction
1	The worlds fish need to be taken care of and if we make supermarkets be more caring towards the fish this will allow other wild animals to eat fish. I am very hopeful this will happen and excited of the idea!!!
4	I want to eat free fish
0	WE SHOULD NOT MAKE SPECIES EXTINCT FOR ONE MEAL
0	This is a great idea. People are socareless sometimes and maybe if supermarket stop selling this kind of fish people will start to buy fishthat is better for you and better for the environment.
1	even it costs more therewould always be fish
1	mass fish catchibg ruins the ecosystem of the sea and runs the risk of causing an extinction in undrwater species. italso ruins the environment by dragging the net along the floor.
1	we have to before it is too late
1	because sustainably caught fish is good for our ?nv®rnm?nt
1	i t is good for our environment that is already   dying
4	we shouldn' t eat fish or any animals
0	animals are here with us not for us!.. we shouldnt eat them!
1	Whilst this is a good idea I have some doubt as some people my not be able to afford it. Think back to some events in the early 20th century.
1	we should look after our resources as it only has limited availability . we should look ahead for those coming along
0	the potential for an entirely sustainable supermarket experience is only limited by cost and accesibility. If it happens and is accesible  to everyonei am as excited as salmon swimming upstream!!!!!
0	i like to see the fish
0	because fish is good to eat.and itis not useing plastic
0	nobody should kill things.Imagine if you foud out that when someone in your famaly was minding there own bissness andd got killed
1	they  should do so otherwise our fish will go extinct and the future generations will  no be able to experience the beauty of our oceans
0	people are surprisingly adaotable en masse and i reckon would accept this like eg plastic bags
0	i believe it is the only way to keep our seas alive across the world
0	you can still enjoy sea food while t endngering species mak the ocean better
0	it would help presrve our oceans and save meny sepicies of fish maybe evensave our reefs and repopulate them.
2	i dont care i love it
1	more should be done to ensure the fisheries future
0	because we will have many species live for ever.
0	because iam staying with my frend and its new years eve
2	The price of these more expensive fish will makecanned and pre cooked fish more popular.
0	im excited because this would help us in he progress of being more aware of how we treat the environment. it still raises the question though of how we will define sustainable fishing
0	Im exited because this would be beneficiary to the longterm health of our people
0	suistanability should be the food industries priority. communities and cities and supermarkets should all attempt at chosing produce that can be visioned still working as a sustainable choicein 50 years time
1	Humanity needs to place ethics ahead of convenience when it comes to the natural world. This applies to both the food we eat and how we obtain it.
0	our planet and alllivingthinogsareatrisk with climateememergency
1	I think its a good idea.
0	I think that  if they do you dont have to kill almost everyday.
1	because hunans are greedy and havibg a sustainable model for fishing is almost impossible
0	because it's the right thing and sustainable. net fishing and comercial fishing hurt our oceans and kill our wildlife. lets go back to the old days of catching our own food.
3	they should not kill the fish dur
0	i think   they should because the fish wil last longer.
1	they should and i hope they do it will help not just as it will help the fish to
1	sustainable practices are the only way our planet can support our population
1	thatus as a planet can save are wild life and help us and are planetto be a healthy plase
0	it is important for the climate
4	i think we may be focusing on the wrong areas and should use our resources in more important areas.
1	that not to many  fish should be cought
0	i think  thatll be a good idea
1	people are becoming more aware of they choice they make
0	we need to make a change
0	we should not eat what the sea cannot give sustainaly
0	because we need to protect our oceans nomatter the cost.
0	because we need to keep our envroment growing well.
0	i think we shoukd takecare of our environment
0	tiki te whanau homai te paki paki
2	tiki te whanau homai te paki paki
4	i have a boyfriend  ### ###
3	we lose to much of our catches
0	All natural food sources should be sustainable because once they are gone it is too late  .
1	yes it would be a great idea
0	our future zshouldhavefish i wll want kaimoana 4ever
0	its just how it should be
0	it is a good step for te future and itprovids hop
3	I'm worried about extinction. I'm also worried that fish will become an expense that only the rich will afford. The rich are the ones that most need to change - price will not motivate this - only stifle the less well-off.
1	Sustainability should be picked up by commerce and encouraged and regulated by the NZ Government
1	i think itwould help recover some fish from going extinct
1	that would be kind cool i guess
0	yeah. the future needs it boys so come ooooon
1	ithibk if you dont votecy urbeer ur aclown
1	fish smell bad etherway so i dont give a shit
2	I am a vegetarian and iodnt thnk eple should eat mea or fis in gpeneral. it would be better if they didnt sell or catch fish at all.   it was very hard to type this sorry
2	I am vegetarian so I dont think people should eat meat in the first place. I tink it would be better if they didnt catch eat or sell fish at all. Thanks
0	The ocean's ecosystem is obe of the biggest ecosystems on our planet and every ocean is connected with the  other. It is a very delecate and fragile system that keeps the ocean working and if disrupted can easily cause a chain rection that destroys the whole system i.e. a species vanishes which may be a food source for another or a preator for the other what can cause everything to collapse. If supermarkets only sell sustainablr fish the and not the harmfully caught fish the delicate system may be proteted
0	to help the repopulation of the spieces
0	hi i am exted because yea i think you know why
1	if humans can do this it would prove we can think outside of 'the market'. Perhaps we could do so for other resources too.
3	beause we should be abil to buy any type of fish not just sustainabliy caught fish
0	Supermarkets should sell sustainably caught fish because of the depletion of fish in our world. Sustainability is vital if we want to diminish global warming and have a beautiful world for future generations to live in. We need to protect the envoirment in order to save it. Even if it means we fish less and for a higher cost.
3	its a bad idea. just eat cookies
0	to save other species which are getting cought exidently to
0	to safe the sealife of the oceans by increasing people's awareness of what and how much they actually consume
0	we do notwant to waste food
4	because is not good for nature
1	we must recognise the importance of the sea for all life and treat it with respect.
1	we need to respect the oceans and respect it isnot an infinite resource for humans to use waste and disrespect
1	because it allows sustainability over time and therefore a better qualityof life
3	how do we know if it is really sustainable?
1	when people fish commecially but in bulk we decrease our chaces of having a healthy oceanlife. every animal seres a purpose by serving another living thing... so when we fish in bulk we take away a large chunk of that wild ocean life. please fish sustainably
0	time to think about our nature
0	we need to leave thisworld in a better place for future generations
0	i think it would be awesome
1	that is good because if you drag the net on the ground it could get snagged and litter the sea.one at a tie is good and use fishing rods it is better
1	so that it is better for the enviroment and hopefully is more healthy for us to eat. And we should not be so greedy and waste so much food that maybe seventy  percent of it goes to waste when other people are already suffering around the world formoneyto buy food.
0	cos if we dont they wont last
1	the sea life ecosytem is fundmental in terms of sustainability
1	If the greedy fishery companies keep going at the current catch numbers there will be none left
1	idealistically its a great idea but also concerning forlower income families
3	too many people say a golbal effort is required butthen always xpect the effort to start somewhere else...
1	better quality more tasty and it is simply fresh
0	because its better for people to have fresh seafood then brought in by the fishing boats
0	because there needs to be a shift  fron corporations first for the consumers to follow in creating a sustainable future
1	that we need to save nature.
1	we need t o look after our oceans
1	we need to think about the future generations
2	Because I am not allowed to eat it
2	because i dont like fish and i dont like shopping and i dont care about the price and stuff like that
1	we need to prevent extinction and takecare of all life on earth.
3	How can we tell what's sustainable?
1	its important to pr?s?v? th? sp?c®?s d®v?rs®ty
0	our oceans are dying. stop eating fish. go vegan.
1	it should be but some people cant afford to pay a higher price
4	yeet you don't make any sense you noob!!
0	Because overfishing is a big risk to our food supply and the ocean's biodiversity
2	because you can still eat it
1	ATTENTION WILL HOPEFULLY BE PAID TO IMPORTANT AND EASY TO FIX ISSUES!
4	i think we shoud leave all animals as they are. going around i see how much much humans have been destroyed the animals peace and distrubed them. why not leave the fish to swim and have fun. we don need to eat animals so why should we? there is so much plastic and mercery in the sea that we shouldnt even be consumin the creatures so we can keep ourselves health.
4	when do stop? should we keep killing creatures until they are all extinct?
2	doesbt nake aby difference in my life
0	planet gone die boys. wake up sheeple
1	##### sent me. i speak for the fish

0	over fishing will impact on all of us.
2	as long as they don't take to much i don't care really   cheap is the ovious choice people
2	because i do not trust tomatos because they are yuck
1	I think it is better for the fish
0	i  think it is important to not overfish because fish will become extinct and fish  are food for many animals

1	if we want ocean diversity then its the only way to go. it seems more people are pushing for sustainability from retailers
0	so there are lots of different fish and they arent all extinct
1	Because then there will be a suply of fish for future generations
1	to keep and protect the marine ecosystem!
1	would be a solution to a problem we are going to have in a few years.

1	it guarantees sustainable food for the masses although not everyone can afford to pay more for it which is an issue to consider
1	i think its important to maitain diversity but only hopeful as it is a dream
0	because we want to eat fish in the future
3	we needto keep nature in balance
3	i don't know if it would ever actually be taken into effect. but it should be.
1	Humans need to stop eating animals but in the meantime this is definitely a preferable option.
0	our endless consumption cannot be sustained by finite resources
1	that it is a good idea because we do notwabtfisht become extinct
1	We should think about the future.
0	i think that we should change thibgs in our everyday life to be more sustainable
1	fish should be caught on a ONE HOOK POLICY.

0	it is compulsary fir the environment
1	just dont eat fish go vegan for the planet
0	the ocean and its inhabitants are beautiful and deserve the same respect we readily grant to humans.
1	because peole are finally takingaction and realising what iswrong  with non sustainable fish
1	ALTHOUGH  FACING MAJOR CHALLENGES I BELIEVE THE INGENUITY OF OUR SPECIES CAN OVER COME THE CHALLENGES AND PROSPER.  HOPFULLY WITH A MORE COMPASSIONATE EYE TO NATURE GOING FORWARD
0	We need to ensure that our marine populations can survive for both future populations to benefit from as well as the marine ecosystem. We need strictly enforced regulations in place.
0	if we don't nothing will be left-just look at the codfisheriesoff canada.decades later and the cod have still not returned.

0	we need to save our planet and the ones living on it...we only have one
1	irresponsible fishing leads to the exctincion of large fish

1	because people are starting to think about the impact of their diet on the environment.
1	because rhen there will be more fish in the sea
0	we will be making a small step towards lokking after our waters
0	We should be mindful of bycatch and only use hook and line pracices. Additionally we should not even be consuming fish in general as the oceans are sacred and a huge part of helping our earth to resore itself after our destructive ways.
0	we need to start looking after our planet not destroying it due to greed
0	to keep up the population in the oceans

3	we shouldnot fish at all. they are innocent beings who deserve to swim freely as we mve freely on earth
0	we need to takea lot more care of our planet. regardless of the cost.....
3	Significantly restrict or eliminate commercial fishing.
0	i love any one called chiken
1	ITS NT ONLY THE PEOPLE CONSUMING THAT SHOULD BE MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT WHAT THEY EAT BUT ALSO THE ONES THAT SELL THE STUFF.
2	i think it is a daum

0	i like muh fish phresh like my women
4	i thibk moto moto likes you
3	i think that they should stop because there are less fish
1	I Hope this is enough. we needto do #####
1	if you give people a cheaper choice they will take it. maybe the government supporting sustainable farming would be an even better solution.
1	we  will  pay  much  more  in  future  if  we dont  act now
0	this is a really good idea andthey will get more money because more people will buy it becauses It's better for are enviroment
1	we should be more mindful consumers
1	we need to do something to help the planet. This is a god start!
1	fish makeup a huge part of the eco system of the oceans. by catching them and thereby removing a vital part of the system we mess around with it to a degree that we yet not fully understand. it might be a good idea to therefore only catch sustainable amounts.

0	we need to look after our wildlife so it will be there for future generations.
1	people should care more aboutthe source of theirfood
1	because we don't want fish to just rot away because thats grss
0	i think we could save the ocean by taking less and giving more
1	because we don't want fish to just rot
1	any attempt to fix things is a step i the right direction.
1	i think this is a great idea. however i dont think that large businesses will do this as they are greedy
0	so we dont run out of fish
1	we should do this for the climate
0	this is an acceptable approach rather than causing extinction of marinelife  .We already purchase farmed salmon.
0	cause idont wantall the fish to die
1	it would bebetter for the enviromnr a
3	cause u shouldnt take too many fish
3	because you are taking more than you need
0	Ekai nga hua whenua nga hua rakau
1	so that that the life in the oceans is sustained.
1	we should becuse it better :)
0	true sustainable fishing is rare. we need to decrease demand tosupply it
1	so the fish dont become extinct
2	i dont mind but i definetly dont want it to be expensive .  but i donteat fish
0	because it means that sea life is protected in a sense but we still get to enjoy it . i want my children and grandchildren and their kids to enjy what i could
0	it is a good solution even if it costs more it will help the environment.
0	Prices need to reflect the true cost of our use of resources
0	i think its a awesome thing to see
2	coz i dnt care wheb im ith my baby yah
2	i think we should not change it to sustainable because the fish we have is ok and if its more expensive then less people will purchase. maybe we could have a few companys selling sustainable fish.
1	because if we donot make moves towards sustainability we wont have any fish to sell or people to at it anyway :D
0	it would be a good idea and a good way to help the environment.
0	becouse we need fresh fish for our country
0	it will allow stocks to recover
0	i dont know what sustainably caught means and that excites me
4	this means that my fish n chips will cost more which means i will become poor coz i live on fish n chips
1	I THINKWE SHOLD TAKE CAREOF THE INVIORMENT MOOR.
0	governments and businesses have more power to affect quicker change.
0	this is a great idea because we will improve or even stop fishing problems. when thefish are saved and there are more of them prices will go back to normal.
4	because you should leave the fish alone
0	that fish can make gentle and sensitive lovers
0	Sustainable fishibg is vital to protect the future generations and ocean ecosystem
1	its a step in the right direction
1	its inportent to have fish in the sea because if we fish to much the  fish will die out and itwill break the food chane
3	i do not want fish to die out
3	we will run out of fish!!!
1	we need to stop fishing because otherwise  there won't be enough life in the ocean.
0	i think it should be catch your own. none for sale
1	government  ans supermarket hains mightcome to their senses
1	i want to help create a better world for my future children. we need to ensure we farm and source food sustainably to acheive that. simple.
0	because food does not reflect the real costs today...
2	fish reminds me of porirua girls
4	save our fish so in the years to come there will be more fish
0	because they got equal right to live on this planet. please dont kill them to feed your kid. how you gonna feel if they kill your kid to feed their family....think about it before you eat them.
0	Kia ora tonu ai m te pp
1	theretically it is a great idea. however the response to the issue must cover more than simply supply. we must also address the overall living cost of nz as is currently one of the highest of third world countries. due to this the solution cannot simply be changing supply and increasing the ever growing outgoings of not so disposal income.
1	because its better for the fish and ffor local fisherman
1	Fish  shouldnot get extinct and should be a sustainable resoure for the future
0	we need to protect  the environment for our future and children
0	would stop over fishing and unecessary marine life killing
0	sustainable fishig is important to ensure our children and their children can continue to thrive and enjoy what we have
3	we might not be able to eat some.
1	the profit motive negates this happening on any meaningful scale
4	we shouldnt kill fish cause they are disgustingand it is creaul
1	it is better for the enviroment and it will be a better and clean world
1	I think they should sell sustanibly caught fish because it would be more healthy but it being expensive is a bit of a problem.
0	we dont want to run out of fish
0	EAT LESS MEAT AND FISH BUT BETTER QUALITY
4	We will not be able to have fish that do not live near NZ.
0	because its the right thing to do
0	because its the right thing to do
0	Because its the rght thing to do and the fsh is not gingto waste
0	the right thing to do and to look after the ocean
3	Dont want any fish to die.
0	because they put back what was taken we will have fish for longer
1	it is inportant for sea life and we could spare a few dollar to help that
0	I would be happy because there will be morefish left inthe ocean for the mrine lifeto eat. If we eat all the fish itwill dissrupt the fod chain.
0	i think it would be beter for marine life because we wont be eating all theirfood source and species wont die out. And there wont be over population of certain species either.
0	i think that this is a good ideaa
1	hopeful feed everyone and save the fis
1	it will help restore the oceans ecosysten
1	i think it would be good forh our oceans ify we let them thrive i hope the people of power willlisten to our voice
3	more money for them less for our contry
3	because ourfish is our sorce of food we should look after our kai moana
0	we need to look after what is left in the sea before it disappears forever
0	tiktok ########### insta ########### snapchat ###########
4	we should add me on tiktok ######### ciao x.
0	add me on tik tok ##############
3	people should care for nature because sea animals and land animals are dieing becuase of people throwing thererubish in the sea or on land
0	let the fish have a chance
3	Everything humans do has a reaction or consequence. Even if the fish are sustainably caught it is a mouthful of food being taken from a seal or shark or penguin. However I would much rather it were sustainably caught than not.

1	we need to look after our fish!
0	because aquaculure could stand to be more susainable.
1	we need to ensure the marine food web is stable
1	if we fish to much its going to kill fish
0	we cant afford to live with unsustainable practices without major consequences
4	fishes are still  animals that means that they help the nature.
1	Otherwise we will all go extinct
1	it ould show we care. if cant afford it sustainably we need to rethink what we are eating
0	the majority of the plastic in the ocean is discarded commercial fishing nets
1	cause it is a start to save the oceans
1	DO NOT WANT TO RUN OUT OF FISH.
1	save some for the fishes. asshole
0	we need to look after the future of the land sea and sky and our children
0	that fish should be looked after
0	sustaibility is hard so if people are doing sustainable things correctly we  know their  putting effort  into  it
1	the cost of overfishing long term outweighs the money issues
1	we canall make a difference.the firststepis to belive that
3	.as we all know supermarkets need money to run their buisness if they run out of money they will stop sales meanining they close if this happens to all markets this could be apocaliptic as the human race has adapted to a much easyer lifestyle and cant gather food on their own. like in nature if one thing gose wrong evrything gose wrong p.s sorry aboutbad spelling
4	yes i think this s a good idea to only stock sustainably caught fish. lets start now!
1	change needs to be lead from the top. i.e the supply end.
1	we need to think and act sustainabily.
1	it will save our enviroment abd ecosystem and willhelpto sustain fture geberations
1	this will help our sea life stay alive
1	This will help protect sea life
1	it wouldbe good because then we wouldrun out of fish later
0	It helps the enviroment in many  benifitia ways
0	i think it is very exciting because fish is a very healthy food ad fish is extremly tasty!
0	the ocean is a livibg being which deserves to be treated accordibgly. it is importat to keep it alive as it provides the earth with oxygen. perhaps the mostimportant thibg to all living beibgs.
1	its the right thing to do.
2	because fish and chips is yum
0	this is a hugley overlooked  section of enviromental sustainability. there is a large misconception that the oceans hold inexhaustable amounts of seafood for human consumption ;there is also a huge enviromental cost. coral reefs for example rely heavily on healthy fish stocks which of course translate into tourism dollars. people need to wake up quickly!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4	because fish are in the ocean and i am sick and tired of being on boat
3	humans do not need to eat fish at all. go vegan to safe oceans
0	so all the fish dont die
0	That way we could lower down the by-catch and give nature space to recover. We don't need as much fish and meat as most of us consume right now. Better one good and sustainable catched fish a week than 5cheap ones. That way the money would be the same and nature couldrecover.
0	so we have more fish in the future
0	its theonlyway to sustain living onthis planet
0	It's important to proect the enviroment now while we still can and safe guard the future so that future generations can enjoy nature like we can
0	to  save the oceans jst stop eating fish
4	man should not eat fishy smelling food lest he become fishy smelling himself
0	we should o something as a community
2	i a not a worried pero and i eat aby kibd f fish
0	Protecting species is much more important than our tastes.
1	gives hope for future of fish
4	ko te utu te raru. kaore i t?nei mhio ki t?nei krero
0	step by step we save the earth and animals
1	because it shall be god for the earth and sea life
0	Sometimes we need to be helped so the right choice is also the easy choice
0	it is not harming the environment as much
0	I dont believe we should have for sale fish that  are not  sustainably caught. I want my grandchildren to still have fish.
1	we shoudnt kill fish anyway just be vegitarian it wont hurt.
0	because it  meanes we can have more fish in th futcher
0	a localised economy is sustainable when foodis caught to send elsewhere it puts a strain on our local food sources
1	i think that it is important  to have sustainable fishing
0	we need fish in the ocean for many hundreds of years to come
0	we need to learn to be more sustainable whatever the cost may be.
1	We can resolve the problems  and save  endagered species.
0	I'm excited because if that happens the world will be a better place.
0	it  should mean that we as humans are healthier
0	because then yiufeel happy knowing your fish is actually good
2	i think that if the fish is healthier it is better for humans and it will also save fish population
1	think this will save fish and humans
1	if fish are extinct we  wont have any fish
0	if future generations are going to be able to enjoy what we have today we need to be sustaibable now
0	cos we need sustainble fisheries to keep  our fisher folk in work
0	it is important to ensure we only eat sustainable fish
0	sustainability and consumer appreciation of food sourced by others for their convenience
0	People who enjoy eating fsh should understand the fragile state of the enviromnent and fish populations. I think we should stop all fishing for extended periods to allow populations to replensh amidst rapid environment loss. Gluttons be damned
1	i think its a good start
1	would help the environment a lot and probably do-able
1	overfishing and the collapse of marine ecosystems are massiv issues and this may help somewhat
1	if people use their collective power to insist on what stores sell and dont sell we could make this possible
3	people are still motivated by immediate reward e.g. lower costs versus longer term benefits.
0	It is important to allow our fish species to regenrate naturally. This would not only benefit fish but also other water based organisms like corals and micro organisms.
1	farming fish is envoromental good.  other wise some of the native fish will dieand become extinct like a lot of spices. the goverment should be on board to help as the goverment is voted by the people.
3	Our children need a world to live in not a depleted rubbish tip.
1	people re beginning to wake up to the consequences of our actions. I hoe future generations are more responsible than past ones
1	the industry will be effected as the amount of fish will not meet the demand
0	it  is the only way for sealife to recover and protect endangered species
0	it's the only way to save fish for future generations and for existing wildlife.
0	if they sell fish that will come back then there will be more fish so they can cach more fish and endagender fish won't die!!!!
0	if they get fish that comeback there will be more fish
4	I WANT MORE FISH MORE CHEAPER SALES
1	i am hopeful that the fishes can succ
4	I am ANGERY because I  L O V E the fishes in my B E L L Y.
4	i am angry because now the fish can t lisen  to THETHANOSTALK

2	na te take kare au  e whakai ana ki nga mhi a te hainamana ki o tatou ika
0	it will save fish populations and the ocean environment.
0	time to change the way we buy food...with sustainability in mind
0	yeeeeezzzeeeez should be sold at all stores
0	this will allow more species to thrive.
0	Sustainability is important when considering the future
1	just makes  sense. policymakers need to make hard structural decisions fo the greater good and pass them onto the economy. better build an obstacle yourself than face a wall
3	This problem is much bigger than just one simple question. It is about climate change and changing the system of capitalism. Of course it would be nice if only sustainable caught fish was sold but at th same time this discriminates people with low income. It would be Classism at its best. We have to think much bigger and change our system so that everyone can fully participate in society while the whole industry is sustainable.
0	because there are more important things than the desire to something for a low rice
1	I think they should catch sustainable fish.
0	we need to take care of our planet or it wont be able to take care of us
0	we need to do this before our fish become extinct or endngered as so many of our ther creatures have become.
0	Taking and selling resources from non sustainable resources is just going to cause the resources to run out. More of this action needs to take place in daily life
3	because we dont care enough about the consequences ofour consumerist lifestyle
1	we should adding fish by doing more farms to release into the sea
1	idk but l ike fish ar yuck anyway
0	yum i like killing animals for food
1	Hopeful that all products insupermarkets will soon be sustainable
0	idkwhat im doing but eh i dont even likenfish bum
0	i think that trying to save the enviroment is our only chance to survive
1	yea nah gotta save the fish
1	bcause it wiuld help the enviroment
0	we dont even need to eat fish yo. ever heard of vegans. we are thriving yo.
0	its ethical and more sustainable in tle long run
3	all the fish would be gone
0	IT SHOULD BE GOOD  BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE FISH IN THE SEA.
1	i love animals and iwant them to be free
1	a step into the right direction. more mindfullness is needed!
1	I trust people to make good choices
0	we need to sustain for the f uture
1	I love the ocean and would love if peoplestarttryibgto save it
1	All fish should be sustainably harvested
0	we should always aim for one hundred percent sustainability
1	this is duable  but it seems they dont care enough
0	suprmarkets have a lot of responsibility on what costumers buy. so if they try there best to save species  the people will aswell
1	it's a good idea to do this so the fish don't become extinct.
1	because we need to save our planet
0	because i think animals should nt be fod for s
4	should not sell fish at all
1	We need to make sure that there are still fish for the next generation
0	we have to consider the life cycle of all living organisms
1	but definitions ofsustainability are difficult to make meaningful.... plus how is bycatch monitored.... iwould rather see fish treated as endangered rather than continuing as an industry and something for our dinner table
0	I think it is very important that the fish supermarkets sell are sustainable. Supemarkets need to lead the way to a more sustainable fishing industry because they are the main buyers of unsustainable fish. The problem is creating a guideline for what is sustainable and what is not.
1	how else do we monitor overfishing and sustainable practices?
1	farmed fish is sustainable and monitored.  wild catch is not.
1	its better for the enviroment and to save speciss
0	Everything sold in supermarkets should be sustainable. Better for our community and our environment!!
0	it means  we might have a chancea at keeping our native marine life safe
2	because there are lots of fish
0	because  farming fish is not good
0	it delete the natural resources if not sourced sustainably
0	we need to protect what we have befireits all gone
0	Because it means that they care for the enviroment and they will do what the can to keep our fish alive
0	i think it is very good
2	i like really like dont like fish like there jst like so slimy and wierd so ya
0	i think that it is really good because the supermarkets care about the enviroment
1	i really hope that it goes well for all of the supermarkets
3	the population has gone down a lot
0	im  really  excited because suermarkets will get better and did you know i got my veryfavourite hair brush form there it has areialon it ive been to diseny land befor have youi liked the flying dumbo ride ther was also food there whats your favorite food mine cabage
1	I Think that it is all right but it still is taking fish out of our oceans but they our slowly getting better and better and hopefully  a couple years we won't even eat fish but for now I guess it will work
2	SO I JUST GOT A IPHONE 11 promax which comes with air pods
2	i am opening a DOUGH NUT SHOP tonight its in ######### school xoxo
0	it is better for the eviroment because it kills less fish
1	i loveee fishand i dot want themto get caught
1	because the world is obsessed with the bottom line and money i can only be hopeful
0	It is a great idea because it means that we will still have fish and less damage to reefs for later times.
1	i think that i dont care
1	i like big ##### and i can not lie
0	it is better for the environment
2	i dont eat fish.. agree that sustainably caught is a good idea though
2	i dont know what that means so idkwym
1	should be good if they pull through
0	it can help solve som enviromental problems. And can help keep fish life growing and can help create a better world
3	this will affected the life of the sea.But this is also affected on how many fish there are right now
0	nothing animal or fish should eaten but at least fish should be sustainably sourced.
1	We may hopefully not destro all species on the planet before we destroy ourselves
2	The cost of living is high enough
0	because  so not many fish have to die
1	we should look after our marine life
0	we need  sustainable fishing to preserve our whakapapa the other issue is  plastic  in the gut of kai moana we all need to be proactive to sustainour existence on this planet.
0	that fish have feelings too #govegan
4	he does want listen what I SAID
0	we should be protcting our naitive sea life
0	because we need to look after there resourses
4	i think it should not happen
2	i dont give a flying toss
0	'sustainable' is very vague. What is exactly meant by this? However the idea of sustainbility being built into the fshing industry is exciting. Overfishing is a massive problem though. I hope that by sustainble supermarkets sell less fish that is caught with  less carbon emissions.
3	No clear definition of sustainable. vague account of costs . Seems desirable on the face of it but needs more detail. This is an extremely dubious survey technique
1	i dont really know we have to educate all fisher people then
0	we should save the planet and help next generations and animals evenif that means we have to make a little bit more effort.
1	because it means they are thinking about the enviroment
0	it would be be benificial to our home . it would alsohelp us leave foodfor the next genorations
1	i think it is good to keep a species of animal alive
0	becausefish nets are catching to much other varities of sea life and killing  fish that are far to small or  not want they wanted to catch. very wasteful inhumane and unnecssary

0	thank you for gold kind stranger!
1	People think more about what they are eating now more than in the past
1	because its good for the sea
1	It seems too optimistic to hope this will happen when there are more economically efficient ways to acquire fish. Though it would be significantly more beneficial in the long run to society if this were to happen.
1	fish is tasty and id like to keep eating it in the future just minus the fishing farms. ever tried white wine and mussels? they hella good!!
3	i think that we should all cool

0	because  we want to save the endabgered fish
4	we shold leave it at the same price
0	it helps sealife and human activity grow
0	we need to think about our impact on the environment and the world we leave for ourchildren
3	that the fish could become extinct because of this.
1	fish populations might be more stable
1	We need to be focussed on sustainable industry. We can't just focus on eonomic growth.
0	humans are wrecking the planet. the baby boomers have set a dangerous standard and then multiplied  like rabbits. leaving the subsequent generations to yearn after their lifestyle but unable to maintain or achieve it sustainably. boomers will die of old age. i will die of climate change

1	driving companies away from profit driven models towards ethical values will always be challenging in a capitalist market

0	it is our obligation to the earth and to future generations.
0	if we keep on fishing and eating like today we will extinguish many different races...the last place not completely demolished by humans should be protected
0	because that helps sustain population growth of specific species
1	i think is very important to keep a sustainable fishery
0	because there will be more fishin generations  ahaid
0	to see where the yer takes me

0	minimise by catcprotect breeding stocimprove heirachical ecosystem viabilitprovide a more realistic economic price for harvesting extracting from the ocean  etc
0	because its going to save our environment and animals
0	because its a good long term goal

0	Because  I cant waitto seenew thing
0	Because I cant wait to see new things
0	tuna shouldnt be sale on can
0	it assures us of fish supply for the next generations even if it may cost more now in financial terms
1	Cost should reflect impact and consequences to influence sustainable choices.
1	i think this is a goodidea
3	because more fish die every year
0	WE GET MORE TO EATANDLIVE LONGER ALSO IS SAD TO BECAUSE ANIMALS DIE AND ANIMALS ARE MY FAVOURITE THING IN THE WORLD JUST BEFOREFAMILY
3	the government sells away our fishing stock to the overseas fisheries
1	it will help preserve our natural resurces
0	It's a no-brainer. It shuld be illegal to use unsustainable fishing practices. You are stealing from future generations and committing ecocide.
4	i think all fish that is caught should be used as nearly all kinds of fish can be eaten. this would mean very little fish is wasted as the fish that is caught and thrown back is alrady dead and just goes to waste.
0	we will alway have fish to eat
0	it is necessary to prevent extinction
1	because the fish population will thrive better due tothe less amount of fish
3	People struggle with change and not everyone will be on board

3	because ##### ####### and her smelly ### ###
0	becauseof chris and his possisionial love of fish hearts and guts he would loveto have a stinky bum for the rest of his life
0	i think its a good idea because fish should be fresh not frozen.
0	we need to look after theocean if we are to survive
1	with the decline in fish populations caused by over fishing and pollution i think it is important for nz to do its part by only supplying the public sustainable and ethical fish options. late stage capitalism my friends
1	supermarkets have started to work with different fisheries to make this a reality
4	fish are mortant for ecosytems and nz has beautiful wildlife
1	i like the idea....yum yum yum

1	our fish species are sacred and special and should be protected
0	oceans are such an important ecosystem  also for the srvival of mankind and it should not be ruined byoverfishing
1	because live in the ocaen could increase
0	im excited because it will keep the fish numbers at a more benefical level
1	Supermarkets should do an effort to preserve NZ'environment- no matter the cost.
3	How will people afford if supermarkets rise the prices of fish?
1	i am hopeful about this idea because there will be more fish in the sea
2	because to me it doesnt really matter
1	we should care for the oceans and the ecosystem
0	because i love coming to te papa
0	I think that NZshould encourage the idea because we must take care of our land and animals for the futre. We cant destroy NZ.
4	fishing is the worst i don't even like fish
2	i am an idot idonteven know what htis is
0	to prevent fish from going extinct.
1	I THINK THAT IF SUPERMARKETS SELL ONLY SUSTAINABLY CAUGHT FISH THE IDEA OF SUSTAINABLY CAUGHT FISH WILL BECOME NORMALISED. THIS WILL MINIMIZE ILLEGAL FISHING PRACTICES.
2	i that if its cheaper than more people would buy it
0	happier fish happier kai. all live matter
1	i think it is a good idea
1	It shouldnt matter the price if we protect those who cannot protect themselves
1	We need to ensure our food sources are sustainable if we want to continue not only eating them but also living in a world with rich biodiversity abd stable ecological chains.
0	our everyday actions need to be aligned with the future we want to live in
0	less polution given off + fresher food
0	I want tobe surethat there will be fish to eat in the future
0	i would be happy to pay more if it helps the environment
1	this shows Kiwis care about our oceans :)
0	it will change our attitudes towards the food we eat
0	fish are for sea livibg creatures not us we should treat this resourse with the up most respect and care
0	we over consume by so much right now. we should all consume less.
0	because its better for the environment
3	because therewill not be many fish around!
0	It is the responsible thing to do.
3	they should let   the fish live alonger life.itis not fair for the fish????
0	i think if supermarkets do thi we will have a better future and we will more sustainble.
3	all of the animals will die
2	you can get other stuff at the supermarket.
0	we all need to be more mindful about our food sources
2	I do not care about this question. I would still buy fish  ceven if it costs more.
0	It's just a better wayof living.
0	protecting  nature is imortant to our life
0	it reduces overfishing so than those fish that are being targeted the most for over fishing can replenish so future generations can enjoy them in the lakes or seas. But the cost shouldnt be affected because there are some people that are on very tight bugets and wouldnt be able to afford it if the price went up.
1	that we allhave to pay a price which will in turn bring awareness
1	N te mea kore au i give a ####
0	we should only use sustainably caught fish if save our enviroment. Only use what we need and make sure we look after what we have.
0	because I care about the enviorment

1	This is a way we can ensure that New Zealands fish suppiy contiune's for years to come
2	before we take care about this problem. we should sort out our plastic problem so that the fish have a good environment to live in which is not surrounded by OUR rubbish. Also why we sould takle our plastic problem first is because the fish are eating the platic and than we are eating the fish so we are really eatting more microscopic plastic particles than the fish itself.
1	it will greatly assist the preservation of marine animals enbdagered byover fishing
1	I think that its imortant to insure a sustainable supply for future generations
2	well my family dosent eat fish and we just get cheap things
1	because it woyld be eco friendly.
1	not only with fishalso with meat
1	EXPENCE IS always a worrying factor when it comes to being sustainable
0	everythung needs to become sustainable for us to continue living on earth
1	if fish are caught and sold sustainably then our oceans will be safer and cleaner for future generations to come.
4	that we need to fish sustainibly
1	How would you knowif the fish were sustainably caught? I still think it is a good idea though.
0	mjk vggtyi think that is a great idea as SAVE THE TURTLES
3	becausse the sea doesnt havemuch fish left.And theirs too much plastic in our ocean.We are not looking after our kaimoana.
1	I'm hopeful that the ' powers that be' are paying attention! It's a no- brainer!
0	we need to save the world
1	supporting a balance in the amount of resources we take from our land and sea is a crucial part in assuring our survivial  therefor i belive sustainable fishing is the only way to move foward.
1	its inportant  to do our bit to look after our land and sea
1	it is a good idea because the fish canbe caught  in such a way that they wont feel bad when they die
1	i think there will be more fish for  fishr men
0	Because it is acording to my mum
4	because i dont care about fish
3	look how many fish hand and animals are getting killed cause us humans eat them MEAT IS MURRDER by the way this is down by a kid.
3	well people do stupid things this is exactaly that even if i eat meat i dont eat fish
0	to keep the environment as itis purenature
0	we should be catching the right amount
1	i think supermarkets have a huge part to play in our sustainable future.
1	it is an idealto aspire to and will hopefully happen.
0	because if we are catching an killing unsustainbly caught fish we are also killing dolphins turtles diving sea birds etc
0	all the fish will be gone from our seas if we do not look after them
1	We are acknowledging the problem and we need to leave this Earth in a better condition than when we entered it for future generations. A small sacrifice now for a larger payoff for all? Count me in!
0	for the evironment and for sustainability
1	they should fish the amount they need
0	itistheonly way that we will ensure  havefood fo rutre generations
1	because it helps save   the environmment
0	better to preserve whats left and have something left for future geneations
0	we must strive to live sustainably
3	somthing will get destroyed to be able to buy fish!.........something will get sacraficed
3	the food dose  not get cecked  before selling  it
3	just another unjustified price increase when we dont get  paid in line with living costs as it is.
0	we should look after our environment and stop raping our oceans.
3	If the cost of fish is too expensive  it will only be reserved for the rich.
3	that the fish will go extinct
0	because there is no allergies so its better for us humans.
1	becaus i they dont there will be none left
0	the world food market becoming more aware is exciting
1	sustainability in all forms will be humanities future
0	I think this is likely to happen in my lifetime! I'm 40
0	i think that if evrey one chips inwe can work together to make a more sustainable world
3	we are worriedabout cost and wonder about the power of one
0	like all natural resources they are limited and must be preserved for future generations. We continue to  depleat resources at an alarming rate and if we don't put the brakes on soon they'll be nothing left to even consider sustainability.
1	it would be great for the environment but it would have to be promoted and encouraged. also the government would have to check it better
2	fish will always be in the ocean
3	because w dintwant fush to become exstinc t
1	we should not use anymore pastic
0	i want to save the planet
0	cus it gives us more fish inthe long run and so that fish dont go extint
1	because some of the fish that are sold in the supermarkets are already like this but there is a hope that there is a change in all of them
1	this reduces the cause of global warming
0	fish is great to eat and needs tobe carefully managed
0	i believe that this is better
1	because itwould allow wild to fish to thrive
0	So we don't deplete the ocean
1	because so we don't destroy the enviroment
1	let the fishes stay in the sea you dont need that snack
1	sustainibly caught fish would be best
1	it would be really cool but it would lower supermarket revenue
1	well we do need more healthy food options and more ofit i reccon there shoul be a higher cost on fish so that it gets into peoples heads that fishes are going extinct but we do need a little amount of fish so that weget variety.
3	im showing my stuff to pepes
0	ALL ANMALS NEED TO BE PROTECTED. THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT GET EXTINCT BECAUSE WE WANT TO EAT THEM
1	our oceans are our bloodline of the earth
0	by continuing to fish unsustainably we are ruining one of the most important ecosystems on our planet
0	Overfishing is a real danger to global fish numbers. We should only take what is sustainable and do what we can to help all natural ecosystems flourish.
1	i hate eating fish but this would be nice!
0	to leave more in the wild is a great thng
0	future generations also like to eat fish
1	we need to pay more attention as to where our fish come from. sustainability is inportant because we want to have them for years to come
0	I am excited because it means that unusual fish do not get threatened into extinction.
0	i love this place is amazing the mad hatter tea party was so fun the shake house as welli love this placeim so sad i haveto leave.
1	I think we need to preserve our species of fish but also worry about people who dont earn much might not be able to afford fish either
1	i think that is good and bad. bad because people that like fish maynot have enough money
0	I think it is good because that means   that there are still penty of fish in the world
1	its for our world we live in
1	we need to change the way we shop and consume to affect climate change
1	i think that its going to be hard to do but  not impossible! GO NZ!!!!!
1	because its better even though its expensive
2	i dont like that type of fish
0	because is more sustainnable to consume local
2	Natemea kaore au e tino whakaaro mo enei momo mea.............
3	maybe some cant afford higher prices?  but it creates better opportunities and jobs. many pros and cons
1	while it is agood idea it will be problematic for those inthe poorer end of the economy and  wouldrequire more structural changes forall
0	we can do so much better if we will
1	I am hopeful about this. It doesnt matter about the cost if it helps the environment.
0	this wouldt affect the fish scarce to our oceans
1	i think this isa good idea
1	Because fresh fish is alot nicer.
3	you will all die some dayhahahahaha
0	fish fish fish fish fishand more fish ha dem fish are big
3	u should not be trusting dem beastly suoupymarkits
2	dont buy fish t is allready to expensiive
1	fishibg industry bad. hope they make it better
1	because fish more important than money and sustanabiity is the key to our planets success
0	that is great news for our fish population abd oceans
1	sustainable for the environment but might be quite costly.
4	THIS IS NOT UP TO CODE!!
3	BECAUSE WE NEED TO SAVE THE EARTH
4	BECAUSE ME WANT ICE CREAM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	maintaining diversity is important to the web of life
1	im hopeful because even if it costs more it is still more sustainable.
0	every kind on earth is important.
1	its good beacuse  its a better fish so ita goodfor expensive fish.
0	to save species make it clear to the consumer to be well aware
1	it is better for the ecological system the environmet and the aimals
1	i think that humans need to handle ressources more responsible even if it costs more. our nature with its flora and fauna is the highest treasure we have so its health  hould be our priority
0	bcos its good for tha enviroment
0	to help the speices remain for the future and protect the eco environment
0	endangered species of fish  wil have  fishing ban abd therefore their numbers should increase
3	Beacause if wekeep doing this more fish could come ectinct
1	Because in the long run  the benefits will outweigh  the costs. Things like this start out expensively becuse they are more niche.
1	Because we might be slowly starting to recognise that change is needed to sav our planet and all of the  species on it.
0	becase its exciteing getting a fright.t hats why   i love fishing
3	because my sibilings cept wondering of
0	because its sustainable therefore we can catch and eat fish for centuries without there being shortages or the fish going extinct :-)
1	don't leave nets in seas. Animmals sometimes get tangled
1	to make a sustainble future for next generation
4	it is silly like ###### #####
1	Species are less likely to go extinct.
1	as the future depends on our sustainability
0	want future generations to have access
0	pay more for good food from good farmers or do not eat it
0	because i want corportions to milk us for more money
1	This should be a government -led initiative with proper guidance about what constitutes sustainably caught fish.
0	the thought the we are doing everything we can to preserve our waters and fish for the next generation is hopeful and exciting. we lead by example
0	whoare we not to??? what right do we have to screw the environment??
1	great the eco systems would stay intact
1	it ishard to make decisions at an individual level. having only good options available in the first place would help a lot
1	i think it would be a great change although it would be hard to pull off and may cause anger from some fishing industries. i stil think it could be done and would help the ocean a lot
1	we should not overfish populr fishing areas o fish breeds
1	i am hopeful to eat fresh fish butwe dont want to kil all our fish so therewill be none left
1	i think my dad is coming back from his 5 year trip to the shops
3	aint got anything to do with you
4	because my dad isnt coming to pick me up
0	i think of the future save the planet
0	we need fish and if you catch all of it we have no fish.
1	if it becomes common practice then intheongterm costs will reduce as fish popuations increase.
4	Beacause I like to eat fish
4	becuse i eat pie in sted of fish
0	because it s a start to a more sustanibe future
0	i think that it  isgreatbecause we will be  only using thefish  we  need
0	because people will hopfuly stop catching heaps of fish and mking them extict it will help fish flourish so future gerourations can enoy learning about fish.
4	I think angry is a very strong emotion
1	it time that man stopped thinking tht he is the sole ruler of the planet. There is no Earth 2
3	Ithink that it is a good idea and that it will be a better for the fish and ocean.
3	Because they only catch fish in the same area
3	Can we really trust that the fish are sustainbly? Even if they are then will there be enough for both us and the ecosystem?
0	so there are fish in our oceans for future generations
1	only way forward or we all become extinct eventually
1	we should takemore careof the invironment and the wildlife including the oceandwellers
1	Preserving the wild life balance in the oceans and waterways is as important as preserving wild  life on land
0	it well be better for the enviorment
1	don' t need to give a reason
4	yourinformation is factually false. youre leading people to your agenda
0	Fish population not sustanable for human population.
1	Inorder to help our oceans we need to find a better way to eat fish. Or maybe we should reduce our cnosumption of fish
1	we should because it is better for our enviroment
0	Fish populations will have more of a chance to enlargen.
0	Fish populations will have a bigger chance to enlargen.
1	we need to start thinking about where we getour fish and food sourcesand ill only start by supermarkets behaving ethically
1	there is a chance we can chane our ways
3	If we really do only sell sustainble fish (which how can buyers trust is sustainably sourced) then will there be enough for us?
1	We should try to encourage sustainabillity through all products in New Zealand. Allthough NZ has such a small impact on global fishing. We should be more of an infuence on other larger countires to be more stable in their food products and hopefully other countires may look at NZ to be infuenced by our ways.
4	because not all countries follow the regulations made by international authorities. ECONOMIC reasons are mainly resposible for  the bad situation. Neo capitalism ruins the world. That means the human being is not resosible enough to be on this planet.
0	because fish is also a living creature
1	To be mindful so that we can preserve our enivironment and fisheries. By not over fishing and receiving quality produce leading to healthier living. Everything has a ripple effect we humans need to act smart before its too late!
0	Better to still have wildlife than avert a spending of a few dollars and not have as much wildlife!
4	i hate fish they are groooossss!
1	because it will provide more fish in generations to come
0	because  it  is  better  for  the  environment
2	i dont know what this is talking about.
0	it s good for the environment and animals !!!;)
0	populations of aquatic species have a chance to bounce back
1	i think that they should not sell endangered fish because everyone should make there be the same amount of each type of fish
0	so there will be more fish in the sea
0	because its better for  the envirement
1	I think itis vital to prevent overfishing and causing major imbalances in the animals of the water
1	It will be god for the ecosystems and our biodeversity as a country!
0	sustainably caught fish will be good for the ocean enviroment
3	because one day there might be no more fish
0	There is no other option if we want to keep using the natural resources of this world
0	get   some hoes for the boys
0	we should watch pawno  in the musem
0	get some hoes all day long
4	we should watch #### to calmus down
0	causefish is good and their feelings deserve tobe felt
0	bettee for the enviorment and better for us
0	I think fishing should be tightly regulated or stopped completely. Noone needs fish in their diet.
1	it depends how 'sustainably caught' is defined. at the  rate we fish now  there will be no fish in the ocean by 2050
1	it would provide the other fish with a chance to live; plus the pricing would let mre fish live!
1	mankind is waking up to the damage they are doing
0	na te mea he rawe toku whanau
0	i think that i im amazing
1	becauce i think its a great idea
0	Because fishing should be sustainable and humans consume way too much and take away so much habitat and food from wildlife. There should be a price for that
1	we need to save or inviroment
1	ithink supermarkets should do there own fishing
0	having regenerative practices in mind when choosing suppliers willsecure our food supply forfuture geberations
0	it is a good idea even if t costs more
0	I think fishing in this way is  must if we want fish species to thrive and survive
3	i think we shoud leave the fish alone and not fish at all
1	too protect diversity in an envronment
0	our oceans are being  impacted by  our fishing indistries
0	ithink that thiswill be a good idea because theoceans fullof fish will stay that way
0	I would rather pay extra if it helps restore our oceans.
1	i think it is good because it willhelp  fish
1	i think we are burying our heads in the sand at the expense of our children.  as consumers we have a choice to vote with our euros and dollars
0	it is good for the envroment and we can have more fish in the ocean.w?  CAn be responsible  so all the fish dont get fishe out. if we dont have fish thats just sad
1	we all take responsibility for a sustainabe future aso consume less in general
0	unless we do this we will run out of precious kaimoana
1	if too expensive no one would buy
1	we should keep all the living things sustainable
0	because it s easier for the consumer to make good choices
2	fishing for compliaments  more like it ya big hrndog
1	dont eat anamals for da dimons
1	its better for fish but the price raise is a bit anoying
2	keep anamals alive not for dimons
0	climate change is is the most important issue currently and everything n our power should be done to reduce its effects
1	A short-term period of the market being required to consume only sustainably farmed fish would be beneficial and neccessary for the natural sealife to be replenished.
0	human existence depends on the health of the oceanic ecosystem of which fish are an integral part
0	because it will save  rare species of fish from going extinct
0	this is a simple way to make our lifes more sustainable
0	this is so cool i never seen this before
1	its considerate towards the future of our ocean life.
0	it is the only way for ALL species to have a chance of survival
0	Then we would be more readily able to successfully catch our own kaimoana recreationally also.
1	should we go to another area #######
0	then we can preserved our fish
1	fihs r suupr yummmm nom nom
0	so there is fish left in the ocean
3	I think that we should limit the amount of fish that we catch because it will give them time to breed.We should  be willing to sacrifice food for ourselves so that the earth is happier and stronger.
0	the sea has been over fished for far too long
0	then there will be more fish inthe ocean for a long tim
0	The ocean is an integral part of Aotearoa and shouldbe treated as such.

0	i thing that it would be great to havefish cout
0	I think we should sell sustainably caught fish because it would save us from havingto find a new species later on
1	yes super markets should only sell stanable couat fish bc we dont want all the fish to go extient
1	i think that all species of fish that are on the vergeof being extinct shouldnt be caught and sold in a supermarket.
1	then it ill be more sustainable
1	becaue plastic is bad for the planet
3	For our childrens future. What will it be like in 10-20-50 years? Will the  oceans be so polluted that even sustainable fishing wont save the oceans species

0	its a great idea to help populations of fish
1	Government should have minimum legal requirements to meet products claiming sustainable practices
4	That catching fish  is horrible because imagine if you are a fish and somebody caught you and then ate you it would be terribly sad for the family.So dont kill fish!
3	because it could harm som fish

0	worth investing now in our land. pricewould ncorage people to eat a little fish and lots ofplants
0	FIsh dont belong to any one generation. They are not ours to take. It is theft.  Straight up. Stealing from kids is not cool.
0	it is better for our eco-system as some of the fish re used as filterz to our ocean and withouth certai fish there would be an overpopuation of a different fish as ther woudnt be anythibg to stop overpopukation
0	I think that you can not possibly put a price on the enviroment because it provides so much for us. By investing in sustainable fishing we are protecting biodiversity that insures there will be fish for future generations to enjoy. How does a couple of dollars compare to the survival of a spiecies.

3	there will be no fish left
0	it would be better if you would stop fishing completly.but its a good start
1	because fear does never work it isonly actions that make changes
3	because i  want to catch fish and i dont like it you kill them
1	ITS A START......THEY SHOULD SELL ANY.
4	i think we shoud leave all the fish alone and not catch any of them
0	i thnk it is important for all indutries to be more sustainable and mindful of its imact on Earth.
4	super market should only sell fish which is approved by MPA
1	wecab save our planet and our inviroment
1	This is incredibly important for our ecosystems and general health of our planet as well as the human population
1	its better for nature and better for sea animals so they can still have food.
0	i think people shouldn't eat fish
0	it will help nature and wont make other sea animals die of starvation.
4	because mum dosnt let me stay

0	sustainabilty is  inoortant n cimte crisis
1	im notsurebecauseour econoy not greatso people might not like howexpensive
0	we need to live long live
1	this is the right thing to do but politics is at play. Unless you get a significant amount of people for it you will have alot of backlash from businesses who make alot more money
1	more regulation around fishing would mean less endagerment for other sealife also.
0	this way our kaimoana can   replinish and  be  sustainble for years to come
0	The fishing stock wont survive otherwise
0	we need to be respectful and careful of our natural environment

4	sea animals are dying because of plastic and people taking too much fish when fishing
0	it is important to fish responsibly as to not ruinthe oceans and the enviroment
0	because you get to eat and stay alive.
1	That if we could achieve this it would be awesome but we need to convince everyone that its a good idea which could be tricky.
0	people should take care of the environment
0	people should know that it's not about money
1	over fishig canlead to species extinction

0	being exicted is a good emotion
1	it would be better for the fish
1	To protect the fish is what matters most
0	its better foreveryone and tastes better
2	Either way it is unethical. Fishing is unnecessary MURDER
2	Estimated fishless oceans by 2048. Sustainable or not fishing is destroying our oceans.
0	it is worth paying more for sustainable and quality food. We need to renew our relationship with our food and not expect it to come out of a packet
1	It will let our fish survive
0	it will help more fish survive
1	we need to be more aware and create te right attitude towards sustainability
0	that  doesnt change our habit because we can still eat fish just a change of recepe
0	because icareabout the enviroment and for future generations
0	becuase i care about te enviroment and its sealife
1	I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS

0	we eat and catch too many fish and waste too many too and dont give them a chance to regenerate
1	because it will probably never happen
4	na te mea he anu koe
0	we need to learn to work with the earths resources instead of using them up; for the sake of future generations.
0	it is important that we take cre of our planet and its species. we only have one so if we stop protecing hat we haveit will leash back at us ultimately leavibg us with big problems. even ifit is more expensive it is better than havig no fish at all in the future
1	it's long overdue... but it is something
0	that we have to consider the future!
0	because we should protect our wildlife and supermarkets have the power to influence suppliers todo the right thing when it comes to product and packaging
0	becase we should be saving wild life
1	Because it would mean New Zealand is finally stepping in the right direction and is helping it self
0	far better the long term survival
0	its a really good thing for the inviormernt

1	there is no sustainable fishing possible. the only really effective way how to protect our nature is by going vegan!!
2	i don't eat seafood so i am not contributing
1	we should fish and farm sustainably
0	because it evens out the population of the fish
0	we need to look after marine life
0	humans are wiping out species at ahorrible rate
1	i have seen peonALLYy the struction of wild slmon from accidents at ish farms. #######
4	This is not appropriate. The issue is how fisheries are run not supermarkets. Stick to low prices and privatize the fisheries like Iceland did.

0	because wewill have ncer fsh to eat
0	this place is  amazing. very fun and kid friendly.
0	nature shouldnt suffer because we want cheap fish. humans think theyre more important than the world itself
1	sounds good but i dobt think business wikl cooperate

1	i think cause it is good for the enviroment.
3	because you are killing the ocean abdthat is bad
1	no overfishing bc we need fish k thanks
1	If more fish are caught sustainably then it could reduce the problem of overfishing
1	PROTECTS THE NUMBER OF FISH IN THE OEAN
1	fishing has been a way of life for centuries and will remain to be a way of life for more to come. however with growing population there is a growing demand. if sustainable fishing is not implemented we will one day come to a world without the variety and amount of fish species we see today. if we arent careful that day will be closer then we all think
1	its not garnteed becuase of the economic values of the idea but i hope it still happens so i and many othars can have a sustainable future
4	too  much fish not getting sold andput up to waste
2	i dont care if somone is intruble
1	because 2020 is a new year for me to be hopeful
1	long term food supply and better for ecosystems
3	arent all nz fisheries meant to be sustainable?
1	it is important to look after nz fish
4	it should not cost that much.
0	fish surviving global warming  and overfishing is more important than the profit margins of supermarkets
1	The pursuit to gain profit has already led to irreversible changes in a multitude of ecosystems. The question of whether or not we should begin to protect environment is a moot point; if we don't start to lessen our destructive rampage there won't be a world for us to live on.
0	otherwise we/th?y will  b? ®n b®g tr®bl?
1	BECAUSE THE POPuation will go extinct
4	the population will die if there is nothing done about it :(
3	Because we might have birds get extinct
1	we need to protect our fish
0	it ensures there will be fish for future generations
4	the place isnt that good because all this stuff was in the olden days
3	im worried that not enough people care about wildlife or the planet or fish
0	it would be a step towards a more sustainble planet and healthier community
2	ido not know and i dont care
0	we should do our best to preseerve fish stocksfor future generations
0	it is fun to know about everything
1	Because it means that  fish wont become extinct
1	its a sign we are looking after our environment.
1	It should mean that we can't overfish our oceans.
0	Because its good for the environment
1	sustainable fishing is very important to save our species. some people unfortunately do not get that and thats why we have to force them to buy it
0	sustainable consuption isthe only way to save our civilisation
0	fish are inportant to our ecosystm

1	it woud help climate change and fist extinction
0	because its better for the fish
4	it would be great and any one who dosent think so should SUCK IT
3	people steal lie and decieve .some are good others not so much.ITS JUST THE WAY WE ARE
0	i think that it will hlp local fisherman as well ashelp the fish population to regrow and recver
0	it makes sense to allow natureto function.
1	to prevent collpse of fish stocks
3	yes excitibg thought. but the cost shoudbt be on us as shoppers. nzers cant contine to cope withthe rising costs of feeding our families. more consideration shoud be made in the laws and policies around fishibg nz including fishing of non nz companies. nz needs to eat more kia moana for affordable prices especially our children.
1	i would help local fishing people and it would be more sustainable
1	because it would be envromentally responsible. And would decrease overfishing which would lead to less extinction in the fish population.
1	ny one question is... is it really sustainable tho? Who is making sure that is.
3	is it too little too late
0	because itprotects the fish for later
1	i think that it potentially could be a good idea because overfishing is a huge problem. however our oceans are being destroyed and filled with plastic that even if it was "sustainable" the fish is still coming from the ocean. their home that we have destroyed. FISH ARE FRIENDS
1	thats a great idea and i hope it very much.
1	this fills me up with hope that one day we do no more harm to the wildlife than its necessary
0	that it would taste nicer and more dellicious
1	hopfully will help better our planetand ocean
1	good idea but cost might affect a lot of things
1	i think it is unlikely the government will legislate. But I hope they do the right thing. NZ is embarrased especially as our dolphins going extinct is in the spotlight. I hope the politicians remember they are people and not just power and money hungry workers.
1	profit shoulden t be more import than our quality of life
1	this might give fish a fighting chance to recover from our abuses.
0	to preserve endangered fishery for future generations

1	good because its better than other fish
4	bc it might be to dabgors
1	there will be morefish in the sea
1	i am hopeful that people will be willing to spend a bit more money in order to ensure the presurvation of the fish in our oceans and that sustainablepractices are implimented
3	we might run out of fis
1	i think that supermarkets should sell fish

1	I think it is good for fish to be caught in a sustainable way even if it costs more.
3	Rising costs means some people don't have access to good food. How do we ensure everyone can still eat well?
1	I hope the fish get caught in a good way
1	bc its good fr the environment and the fish populations too.
0	only the best for me; ####### #### ##
0	as the largest source of to the human species it is crucial to our survival
1	IF we eatall the fish there will be none left.  Its as simple as that so we should eat on sustainable fish.
0	so there are still fish in the ocean
0	so we still have marine animals
0	I feel excited about this because it means that certain types of fish that people eat will not become extinct and it will be better for the marine ecosystem  as marine animas that also eat that type of fish will not become extinct from starvation as their food will be there for them to eat.
0	our planet is worth so much more then stupid money. actually they should not sell any fish at all
0	I AM EXCITED TO COME IN TE PAPA
2	his because i dont do shoping
4	because fish r beutiful they need to live
2	because i love to catch fish and deep fry them.
3	yeet yeet yeet yeet yeet yeeeeet
1	labour is putting quotas on some fish and should also introduce prohibition of drift nets
4	Fish can be farmed. NZ has lots of appropriate water resources for this and NZ could lead the way in developing the techniques and technology to do this responsibly. Instead people whinge and do nothing.
1	large scale fishing is ruining the oceans with the variety of foods available today there doesnt seem a need or place for it.
0	i think this is necessary to sustain the fish population
0	dont eat fish you sefish wankes
0	we will run out of fish otherwise
0	all food we eat should be from sustainable sources.. so we can sustain our way of life.. simple really
1	not enough places do this so we are hopeful to see more places take a more environmental and sustainable approach
1	the price will go up when demand rises anyway
1	im hopeful because as long as the fish is clean and fresh than i amhopeful
1	this would be good for everyone
1	i think it protects the future for generations to come
0	supermarkets have the ability to change the way we consume given their purchasing power
1	sustainable fishng etc is vital for the survival of many species of fish......they MUST be givn chance to survive once lost they are  gone......FOR EVER
0	sustainable ressources are key to sustainable lives in the future
0	I think we need to respect all forms of life.  There is  no need to decimate any species for tthe sakkeof humans.
0	eat less of the best. save todayfor tomorrow
4	we have beenwarned oftheoverfishingfor along time. wemust legislatebeforen itistoo late   NOW. No more excuses.  ENFORCE  MARINE RESERVES.
0	i think people are over fishig
1	young people are becoming more aware
0	because it is important to protect the earths resources
0	It would be good for the environment because it protects our resources.
0	only these kind of decisions will have a real impact.
0	what fishermen catch should be sold not thrown back as  bycatch
1	I think it is important for people to know where their fish is from and how its been farmed.
0	im really happy im at tepapa
0	I agree with this because i think people dont care about other living animals. it doesnt matter if its more expensive
2	because im #### years old and i dont go shopping hard im ## andi dont care eithersorrygrnny
1	because it is really important  that we have healthy fish that goes into our bodies insteadof plastic over taking our  bodies and polluting not just the ocean but also our bodies
0	I like everything so far. I cant wait to see more. I also think its pretty good since I hadnt been here in a while
0	need to change consumption hbits and start payibgthe real cost of what we use
4	we are killing our oceans. we need to stop all fish and replensih the stocks of  all fish. stop humans beig so greedy and selfish
1	it is a step towards a more sustainable future
1	it would help spread the message that we have stewardship of the planet and we should look after it  :0)
1	keeps the ocean alive and fun.
1	Because people will change with time.
1	I think this will be good for the enviroment because the fish spiceis will be able to survive and multiply so endangered speices will come back . WE DEPEND ON EARTH#SAVE OUR PLANET        REDUCE     REUSE            RESYCLE    &#STOP THE BURNING OF FOSIL FUELS
0	im constantly amazed with how much nz cares and is ACTIVELY doing things for the better for the planet. sustainable fish and poultry would make such  a lrge positive impact !!! :)
2	I Dont Know Wat This Is
0	the way it should b done to preserve
3	that some people wont be able to aford it
3	the reason why im worried is because the fishthat we dnt catch means that then there is nopoint of catching the other fish so just eat the fish that you cacht first then eat other fish and then maby it wont be a problem
2	we can catch how much fish we want because there is many fishes left
2	i am going home so i am not in a mood
1	so you can save the planet
4	thats the reason why fish is so expensive these days.affortability is all about these days
0	i do not care i love fish

0	save what we have left before it is too late
0	fish are yummy and cool :)
0	it is better for th einviromant
0	the world is suffering from many animals and species dying which means if it would make a difference in keeping our sealife safe.
0	it is better for the sustainability of nz
1	there is a need for conservation to e taen more serious and produce is a good way to bring in the general populus but more dirastic measures are neededfor real change to occur with the end goal of helping our enviornment
0	thi s is a good iea
1	We are willing to pay more to protect the future
0	it is vital to keep our oceans full of life. This is one way tohelp preserve the oceans and the marine life
0	it's better for the fish and all the marine life
2	as long as i can eat it im happy
0	This is a good idea in theory but the cst of both a dereased supply and people investigating the sustainability could collapse a lot of fishing companies. Locally bought and producedis always better than other options.
1	that not everyone agrees in this question so many wouldbe upset and the suermarket would propably take it back
0	we need to be more aware of what we eat and more inovative about how we eat it
1	I HOPE FOR THIS BUT AM REALISTIC
0	So that my childrenand grandchildren and so on can enjoy a healthy varied diet.
4	not really a fan on eating fish but feel sad for them
1	to help keep our resourses in tact.
1	I hope this will keep fish alive and help them in their battle against pollution

1	its important to look after our fish.
0	yes commercial    fishing is ruining our ecosystems
1	i like to eat fish so we need to fish sustainably

0	ethical food methods keep  the fish around for the long term and keep the ecosystem healthy(constant).
0	we should stop or eat less fish. they have the right to live like us
1	because we have to protect our natuer
1	It is better for the enviroment and its not really nice to kill a living being.IF YOU EAT IT AT LEAST KILL IT BY YOURSELF !
0	if fifh are nearly extinct donot eat them
2	kcffwkkeiz **09!@!38njzyu?k?j?zq! ( 12  2$ #12.

0	fickt euch alle einen schoenen gruss ab ie deutschen die dies her lesen. ICH bin IN der TAT auch DEUTSCH WELCOME  HERE
0	I THINK THAT FISH IS COOL
3	as greatas this idea s too manpeople verfish
3	as great as the idea is  too many people overfish. it will only work if everyone does it
4	if this keeps happening then we wont have any fish and that could kill our eco system!
1	i believe that althogh an environmentally sustainable move   there are many stakeholders that will seek to oppose it
1	some fish is good and some fish are bad toeat but most of the fish you ccan eat
1	i work in the fsh industry. it is not the industry that is resonsible for bad fish stocks. it is the giant supermarket chains who only want to sell at the lowest price. but above all. politics is the reason for bad management of the fish stocks. politics is the main reason why the transition is going so slow
0	bcause we cant keep eating our animals irresponsibly and with such cruelty
0	i think it is our responsibiity to take care of the Earth and treat the species on it with respect. Sustainable fishing is part of this.
4	ignorance from majority of people whohave no respect forthe environment
1	we know why we shoukd do this. definecost more
0	filthy capitalist supermarkets are the root of all evil
1	big business needs to take a lead
0	supermarkets should not sell fish instead usibgpivate fish arkets run by people who depend on their fishing
1	it will be better for everyone
1	I think thatfish have  right to freely swim in the ocean
1	its a step in the right direction
0	we shouldnt eat as much as we do anyway.
4	Because fish and eat fish is finishing the sea resorces and wild sea live of our planet. GO VEGAN or vegetarian at least ;)
2	dont buy fish from a shop
2	just leave all the fish alone
0	sustainability makes sure the next generation can enjoy it  too
1	to prevent the collapse of fish stocks andsurrounding native species
0	We need to protect our environment!
1	anything that protects our natural resources is a great idea
1	extinction is already a big problem in nz and fishermen all over the world are over fishing every day. this  is a problem and we need to stop now. otherwise our fish could all go extinct like the countless native birds and other animals.
1	things can get better for a better future
0	We should care about our environment and the animals! But all meat they sell should be sustainabe not only fish.
1	we should place bans onfishing at spawning time

2	many people n earh require diferent solutions on how we will nuture ourselves
1	it can be one small step to help earth to become a bit healty
0	so species do not become extinct
1	lookig afterour enviroment is more imortnt than earning money

1	becase its not hethey for uss
1	The exploitation of our fisheries is a symptom of the way we view natural resources in New Zealand. We must act as kaitiaki for the future and act now
1	it will bring  back endangered fish and dolphins.
1	evie thinks people are more aware of their impacts
2	i thin that fish should be cheap    because food coast to much money
0	i get to lrn more things
1	the supermarkets have a social responsability to give goods to the customers
2	i dont pay attention to that kind ofstuff anna oop
0	SO OTHER GENERATIONS CAN HAVE KAI MOANA. IT WILL ALSO GIVES A VALUABLE EXPORT AS OTHER NATIONS DESTROY THEIR FISHERIES
0	PLZ FOLLOW ME ON TIKTOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  NOW OR I WILL STEAL YOUR FORTNITE ABD CHOCOLATE!!!! @###_##_####_#### :) have a nice day
4	Fish are our right as the top of the food chain and thpeyppp are very yum especially salmn. i dobtcare aboutthe fish
0	we have to protect our environment
1	sustaibale fish is best ofqualtz and wereduce the consumtion fantibiotics
1	because the fish are struggling kia kaha
0	compromises are imperative t the prospeity of our fishery and agricultural industries. technology leads the way to the sustainble future so difficult to imagine as we attempt to develop as fast as it does. get on board ladies
0	i think we need to take better care of our environment and that this would be a big step towards stopping some marine life becoming extinct
0	we should all care about this. it impacts so much more than we imagine
0	at some stage we need to care for this world that sustains us. all the little things count...
0	That it will make a difference in the long run.
0	Even though it will make it harder for some people to purchase fish there are still plenty of different types of food they could buy.
0	I eat fish rarely bt when I do it should be great quality. that includes sustainable growthof the fish
0	even betterwould be not to sell fish at all. would help against overfishing.
1	so it isnt killing of all the fish.
1	because tomorrow is Sunday except where it is not
0	i dont eat fish but careabout thiereco system
1	because it will gve everyonea chance to survive incl. the fish
1	because itkeeps the number of fish even
1	the enviroment need to recover from the things we have done
0	I think it is a good idea as it helps nature.
3	because of  diseases they can carry
1	beacuse we should save someforour kids
0	we wold have healthier oceans and more sea life to see and explore
0	it is good for the ebvironent as if they bexame extint then it could upset the ecosystem. and as a vegitarian i don like te idea of animas dying nor does any sane beibg lik th idea of genocide.
1	Resources are finite and as we go on we need to improve
1	we should take care of our nature. we have but one planet.
1	better for the enviroment i guess
1	sustainably caught fish relieves ecological stress while maintaining equilibrium in the ecosystem.
0	we dont want fish to become exinct from over fishing
0	thats an amazing idea! save the ocean!
0	it would be a step in the right direction. we should all be doing what we can to help save the earth before it is too late.
0	we all know stocks are being depleted through over fishing and over consumption. We over exploit our natural resources in order to make a dollar with total disregard for the balance of life in the oceans.
1	it is good for the environment but the measure should be regulated so that people wont be paying high price for nothing
0	because they waste so many ika that could have a life
1	WE SHOULD NOT DAMAGE SOMETHING WHILE WE KNOW BETTER
2	i like ### and ### and u shld too x
1	###### ###### is bae. you cant disagree.
2	the heavier u r the harder u r to kidnap. Stay safe and eat cake
0	because we should protect the ocean ecosystem aswell as our land ecosystem
0	We all pay a price to live in this world-I would rather my price be a bit higher in th name of sustainability.
1	I believe that it is a good idea but I hope the idea becomes reality as there are many boundaries that the idea would have t cross. Pubic opinion would also be a  matter as food in NZ is already quite expensive so what would this entail for the fish market in NZ
1	otherwise we will loose many  types of fish
3	WE NEED TO SAVE THE FISH AND THE ANIMALS  .  DONT OVER FIH AND POLUTIE
2	i dont know enough about it
0	we have a duty to care for  the planet and though i would vote for not eating animals at all at least this moves us closer to caring as we should.
0	crack is bad cause the crack heads are coocoo
4	i am angry cause someone ate my cheeseburger
0	its so important.our world is in crisis.we need to starttakingresponsibility forit
1	fish will become unaffordable but how else can fish stocks be saved?  More research and trials to investigate the potential of fish farming?
3	gurnard will become harder   to catch becuase the are not schooling species and they live on the seafloor sometimes so you need a special rig to raise your catch chance to somthing abve 30 percent. i have heard it is a damaging practise for the seafloor
0	its time to preserve the ecosystem and stop pollunting the oceans with boats and human presence.Listen to ##### #.
0	fish are swag and you are swag so we shod all be swag together
0	we are resposible for the sustainable and ethical treatment of the ocean and all sea and water life. tiaki taiao.
0	Hei oranga taiao; hei oranga tangata.
2	I dobot like fish much so... yah
3	that we should think about our fish being exported cheaply overseas first
0	NOT EVERYONE HAS TIME TO READ LABELS.
0	i think it is betterfor the envierment
3	this is the only way our fish will survive
1	that fish have lifesand we should respect them
1	I think that we should only catch sustainably so that we can still have cod and tuna when we grow up! If we don't then the dolfins and sharks might be in danger too! Help the sea life and only buy sustainibe food!
1	that all the fish have familys and we cant just think thatwe are the only animals with emotions and feeling ITS NOT FAIR FOR THE FISH
1	That if they go and buy fish fromun sustainable places tey are killing the environment. And who knows? Maybe the fish they buy are unhygienic and poisoned. Either way they are helping the fishes extinctionand the eventual extinction of us
1	Becuase its what we should do. DA.
1	it would be another step in the right direction
0	its better for people nd the envronmnt
3	no governments are doing much about climate chang
3	we need to leave the nature we inherited as good condition. keeping sustainable fish stock in nz waters is important
3	if you're buying non sustainable sources you're contribuiting to loweringit s stock and that leads to more endangered sp. buying healthy fish populations prevents from lowering sp and its more sustainable
0	food chains must take responsibity for providing products from  sustainable sources.  they have a majoy role in helping public change behaviouralpatterns.
3	plenty of fish the ocean is far biggerthen humans will ever discover.
0	we  need the fish for the furture. and we need to respect them
1	we need to sustain and p rotect our oceans and kaimoana
1	so our next generation will be able to have kai moana
0	I think that we have got ouselves into trouble so now we need to get ourselves out of it and only shopping sustainable got fish will do just that!
0	I think itis a great idea! Because lots of fish are endangered and going to waste because of mass fishing and people aren't even eating it all. Even if it costs more for us and the fisherman it will defintly help the plant; ocean and fish thrive.
0	i think that this is a great idea because u r saving fish and ur stopping more endangered speices
0	It is crucial that we conserve the oceans resources ornot only will important fish become extinct but humans will have no food.
1	I hope that everybody can make the change.
0	I like fishys and I dont people to hurt them
0	People should be resectful to othr living things like fish. Since we are mass fishing we are wasting fish and sea life. so by making this change I am excited to see more fish and sea life in the ocean.
0	jbecause we need to be able to keep our fish stocks in good orderto be abletoeat in the future
0	so we can et fish in the future
3	this may cause  stress withen the publicand cause people to get a pay raise for expense
0	Its time we do the right things instead of making decisions according to short term fiscal gratification. Thats why the planets in a mess now.
1	BECAUSE it would be a shame to loose most of our fish and we have to care a bit more about our planetwithall the stuff on it
0	want to be able to eat fish all my life
1	It would be idealistic but would act as another barrier for some people to  access a balanced diet. Regulations could prove to be difficult to enforce. I think we should try whilst protecting both ourcommunity and the environment
1	I think this is a great idea. Even better would be to create fish farms to offset sustainable fishing even more.
0	better for the fish and the environment
1	people need to be educated when itt comes to conserrvation
1	i think its a good idea beause its good for the environment and future generations.
4	I think the decition to make plastic bags illegal is rubbish we should be abe to make free choices for or country and future thank you.
1	great idea but cost could be an issue for some
0	Lets stop eating fish altogether.  There are heaps of other sustainable and delicious things to eat without having to worry about depleting the oceans biodiversity any further!
0	i think its ok as long as you  grow them again
0	it is good for the enviroment and it is good for the ocean
1	what could happen to the economy ? on the other hand sustainability is VERY important to survival so it could be possible
1	I think fish shouldn't be caught at all butit is a reasonably good idea!
4	The convenience of fish is important to the human body
0	Fish are an integral part of the biospheres ecology. W? m®st l?rn to respect this and fit in with nature rather than use and abuse it..
0	to see stuff at the museum
1	with the right message we can get most people on board. less of what we like consumed in a different but sustainable way.
1	I hope our children have the same opportunities te experience fish as we do
0	our planet must be everybodies first priority
1	the more attention s brought to this situation the more chsnce thinges might change
0	we have to protect what we have and help restore sensitve ecosystems
1	we dont want to deplete our fish
1	The voices of conservation scientists are being heard loudr and louder. Hopefully there are important changes like this around the corner
1	we have to secure the future of the fish we harvest. or there will be no future harvest.
1	commercial fisheries are damaging marie biology and aprice premium is a worthwhile solution
1	because people are realising the impact of living in a way that is not sustainable
1	becauseits stustainable which means its better for the enviorment
1	at one point all fish was sustainable.  restricting is the onlywe we can maintaina viable food source
0	we are taking too much from the oceans
0	fishes are animals too abdtheyhave feelings just like us.
0	OVER FISHING IS A MAJOR PROBLEM
1	there will be more fish in the sea
1	because we have to protect our animals even if its a fish a bird or even a tree wehave to look after our wild life
1	i think also need to consider the livelihood of  fishermen when consideringsustainability
0	self sufficient food production neded to save the environment
0	it is good for the enviroment
1	there may be support for this idea
3	beacause fish ae animals and to  some people fish are just like their dogs theotherpeople see them as food now do you see your dog as food that wath i  throught
1	We must protect species for the future.
3	we must be brave and make the right decisions. including big business
0	because its inortaibt for the ebvironment
0	because we have to do every thing to save the earth
0	because we are at a point where our survival on earth and the survival or our native flora and fauna needs to  be a priority. eating animals is no longer our only means of survival. satisfying  our temporary sensory pleasure isnt woth the loss of life or devestation of our oceans. overfishing is about greed not survival
0	we all need to share responsibility and take action to reverse the damage toour planet we humans have caused
3	we really     need to  look afwdfsfgsr
0	i think because we souldnt overfish the sea
0	i think that we should not take too many fish from the sea because we will run out of fish
0	its better for the future enviroment
1	fish is good for cooking and eating.
1	It is better for the planet.
1	it is a step in the right direction.
0	I think  the world needs our help to survive.
0	society must act soon to save our planet
0	society must act soon to save our planet
1	I am hopeful we can all become kaitiaki and live sustainably.
0	It would be better for our oceans.
1	so we have more fish in our seas because fish are good
1	i am hopeful because if we can commit to making changes like this then Aotearoa may yet have a long future.
1	sooner or later we humns will rrealise that weare in the ####
0	because itis better for our world even if it costs morewe would notbe alive if the world was not sustainable and just plastic so its better!!
1	thatthis could be  a good way to save theplanet
1	thatthis could be  a good way to save theplanet
0	so fish  stocks are managed for future generations to enjoy and for the preservation of species
0	fisheries if the future depend on our actions today. seafood is a precious gift and it should be treated as such.

0	fish are friends not food xx
3	if it was a rare fish
1	we need to protect the fish population
0	i want enough fish left in the sea so they can breed
0	thats what the whole world should do
1	to only buy fish from the super market that there are lots of that species not the rare or endangerd onecause we dont want them extinct like the moa and other animals
3	i am worried because there is too muchplastic in the ocean and it is killing the animals in the ocean
3	im worried that theres tomuch plastic in the sea and i wanevery oneto stop using plastics to save the sea life theres only 50 mari dolphins left and theyare only found in the north island of new zealand                     SO STOP USING PLASTIC
1	the ocean is one of our last great rescources and we need protect it and make it sustainable for future generations
1	if its normal to pay more everyone will get used to it
1	then i dont have to eat fish
1	i think we should not catch too many so they will multiply
3	It's a good idea for long term sustainability but I do worry how it would effect my family of multi-generation fisherman.
0	i think laws and regulation are the only way to effect real change. its hard to do things voluntarily butifforcedwe would alldo it
1	It's better for New Zealand's economy;for the environment and for sustainability.
1	sustainability is the answer to most current global concerns
1	saving our bloody planet one fish at a time!
1	we should stop putting our fish in danger

4	lets make the world a bad place
0	lets make new zealand future better than ever we say lets do this
0	lets do this lets make new zealand future better than ever
0	Great idea! We need to globally make this and other ideas a real thing so that we can be working towards a sustainable future as soon as possible.
4	they are killing good fish for no reason and sellig it when barely anyone buys it!
0	they should sell more good fish but be careful about catching fish that is not endangered.
4	sell more good fish be careful catching itand because I love fish
1	fish will be extinct if we dont restrict commercial fishing especially fresh water eeling
1	because so it saves the fish
0	because it feels like some thing is going to be fun .
0	because I get to eat more fish

4	i like money and cheap stuff
0	it makes me hopeful for a kinder future
0	more sustainably caught fishcouldlessen potentially harmfulcommercial fishing
4	i am angry becaus people are not respecting the sea
0	that is a good ideafor the enviroment
1	we must respect the animals we eat by eating less of it. meat should never be cheap as animals give their lives sowe can live
1	we need to help to care for the ocean's sustainability.
1	the world has limited resources so  we should limit our consumption
0	we dont need it. nature do
3	Ithink that fish are to stay inthe ocean.
0	we have a duty of care of our land and seas to ensure ongoing survival for all species
4	cus my best friend said so
0	so my family can enjoy the same ocean i have
0	we must ut our nature first above food desires especially
1	we need to care for the environment
0	because it is the step  in the right direction
4	because we as a country should be more sustainable and help fish for the future
4	Bcause weshouldnt eat meat a tall
0	that will be a better   option for the longer run
0	because so the ocean can recover from exploration byhumans
0	sustainable fishing is the only solutionandthe  only way forward
0	because it is a good idea .
0	its important to protect the Earth for future generations
1	we need to protect our fishes
1	because if we dont fish will go extinct
0	sustainable fish is better than farming fish and over fishing
0	I think we should SELL LESS FISH
1	we must preserve nature for the future
0	thatwe should not sell so much fish
0	helps economic growth and prevents spread of disease
1	it will be better for the wolrd
1	it would be good to have sustainibly caught fish because then the fish popuation can re-grow andthenthere canbe more fish
2	I dont care beacause  ive seen and tryed fish.
2	I hate fish and I LOVE my parents -
2	I dont care beacause I dont like fish
0	that all food needs to be as susinable as ossible
1	because i think it would be good for new zealand and our fish
0	sustainably caught fish makes me feel better when eating it
1	Its a great idea. But supernarkets dont care enough to bother.
0	its important to think what comes after us
3	the ocean is very important in peoples culture and lifes  and anything that is taken should be put back
3	Fish are very important  part of the sea and if  we dont  respect them  they will bounce back at us
3	supermarkets should only sell organic things or animals that have been brought up to be food instead of caught in the wild
1	The price of sustainability is our lives. we must learn to accept and reflect that
0	i beleive that supermarkets should sell sustainable products to accoodatte o the eco system
0	this is realy goooooooooooooood even trought i dont eat fish
1	supermarkets need to be ethical sources of fish
0	we shouldnt fis at all butlike sustainable is an improvement
1	it is quite a good idea in my opinion
0	people need to be more responsible for their impactinthe world
1	that it will be awesome so i hope it happens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	fish stocks should be maintainedto enable the waters to remain as natural habitat and avoid extinctin of species man needs to rethink how and what we eat
1	if enough people go for sustainable food eventualy stores will bow to commercial and human ressure
0	there isagrowingmovement particularlyamongst the young which recognises the absolute needforchange in the way we feed ourselves and protect the world. there will also be an economic cost if we dont change our behaviours which will impact our main industrial food supplirs
1	groceries make up a small portion of ouroutgoings. we can spend a bit more
1	the whole owrld shoukd be more sstainable in as many ays as possible
1	then fish will be around for longer
1	we need to protect this planet
1	we all should care. but sometimes it is hard for some family to pay even more for getting their food already.
4	fish n chips make me want to lick my lips
1	creating a sustainable future for our tamariki
4	commercial fishing needs to be kept in check
1	that soper markits shodint be using plastik
0	because sustaibability is our future abd we nust protect our oceabs for geberations to come
0	because then there will be healthy fish populations for future generations :-)
3	most we have at present isnt sustainable
0	yes they should so that theres plenty left for the next generation
3	we need more shell fish in the supermarket
1	good premise however its sustainability is only viable if the outpu is predetermined. demand cannot influence increased supply which will make fish a luxury unless subsidised
1	The increased cost of sustainable food could contribute to food insecurity in marginalized communities. Subsidizing sustainable fisheries could makethis option better for consumers.
0	it is betterfr the envroment. stanabilty will benift humans survile.
0	its the right thing to do
1	we  want the  fish to survive  and not become extinct.
0	because we need to live of our local produce if possible. This way  we stop poluting by moving  produce all over the world.
1	because its the right thing do. WAKE UP IT WONT LAST LONG.
0	i want fish to live and not die
1	its important to reserve fishing stocks and not over fish the waters
0	preserves stocks difficult tocatchthe wrong type of fish in quantity
0	a sign of our ability toevolve our thinking and rebalance how we live
1	I think this because fish are part of the ocean so we cant just keep killing them and eatibg them because our ocean wont be an ocean anymore
2	people shouldnt eat fish if they care about sustainable eating
0	future generations can see them in the wild
0	so next generations can enjoy like we do
0	because NZ is known for our abundant seafood
1	healthier for us and for them
0	it would be better for our health and for the environment.
0	sustainable and local food consumption is the only way forward.
0	i think all food in suoermarkets should be sustainably produced or caught
0	fishmust be caught in sustainable ways to ensure the survival of species in the future.
0	we ned to ensure all fish caught is sustainable
1	so there will be more pancakes
1	Positive policy that requires strong compliance enforcement and prosecution should anybody go against quotas. Ultimately we need informed science on acceptable numbers and reflecting existing fish populations in a changing climate.
4	It should already be the case and be normal.
0	i think its a great idea. catching fish from a sustainable resource provides so many benefits to the ecosystem
0	" just stop being ratchet to fish aye-"POP SMOKE
1	its a good way t save our planet and to help not destroing nature even more
0	eating fish contributes to the decline of so many species  because ofthe waste fish that gets caught without being  the targeted fish. so myfirstresponse would be stop   eating fish. but if we have to eat it. then at  least in a sustainable way
1	i like fishing and at the moment i cant get not one :(
0	diversity and  protection for the future
1	people care more about money abd self benefit than the health of our planet even though it affects us directly..we just choose not to notice or we ignore it. i am hopeful that in the future we take responsibility
0	maintaining species diversityis crucial to maintaining ecosystems and thus life on earth
1	because if it is not sustainable the futurE generations will not get to enjoy it.
0	to be able to eat fish with my kids in 50 years
0	ROBLOX IS COOL BECAUSE IT CAN BE REALISTIC AND COOL
0	ecuse its better for the word
2	cause i dont globalwarming is still coming
0	i dont want the fish to turn gay
0	Better for the sea environment better for the fish species better for the fishing industry in the long term.
0	we all should thinkof our future and do what we can to reduce the damage that were bringing to this wrld atm. moreover we dont need to even eat fish and or meat
1	that supermarkets should catch more crayfish!
0	that fish should be treated better and reduce the amount of fsh caught
3	That selling sustainably caught fish isthe first stepbut e really just need to stop eating fish!!!!!!!!!!
1	i think thatsustainablysourcedfoodis betterfor the ocean and iwouldnt mind paying mre
0	Its important to live in balance wth nature
1	i hope that we can restore our native fish reserves
3	we should stop eating precious fish full stop
1	good idea. But we need to reduce how much meat and fish we eat overall or the planet will crash!!
0	to keep up w/ demand and save for the future generations
1	it would show we are taking the problem seriously
1	its a move in the right direction
2	we can be practical i guess
1	Simply necessary. Not much faith in humans though.
0	we need to look after our sea
0	GREAT IDEA. GOOD FORTHE ENVIROMENT and nature
4	we should stop catchingfish instead we should let them live there life like we do to each other so stopkilling the ocean!!!!!!!
0	fish for the future and therewill alwaysbe re kaimoana food from the sea
0	i think its a goodidea thx for asking :)
0	I think over fishing plays very significant role in terms of the decine of pengiuns in that theirb food sources has been demolished.
0	We have greedily taken too much for too long.Our Earth can only hold out for so long before thedamage wrought is irreperable.
1	we need to start looking after the environment
1	hopefully we can live in a more sustainable world in the future
1	it could be a great way to make a change.
1	we need to look afer our planet
0	the least we can do for the ocean
0	because some fish species are dying out from overfishing
0	hopewehave reacheda point where we realize we have to take action
1	people will start to value the ocean even though its harder to see.
0	we need to consider our future and our kids future .over consumption and abusing our natural resources is no longer sustainable or acceptable
1	New Zealand is starting to move back to our connection with nature. Kaitiakitanga is becming a priority for us again.
1	We should start using more money on fish because we are eating too much fish.
4	####### cheating on ##### with #######
0	we need  to look after our plaet
1	it will alwys give other markets that do it diffrent but i hope that one day the world realize that it is more importat to look after our nature and animals that ourselfs
0	the earth isin BIG trouble and we need to fix ourproblems
2	dont eat itif you dont like it
0	cause then we will have food into the future
2	theres plenty of fish n the sea
1	it has to be the way of the future but science and economics also need to work to keep this food source accessible to all
0	good step in the right diection
0	we have one last chance to get this right... for our grandchildren
1	People are starting to realise that we need to change right now. I used to be scared and feel hopeless now I feel hopeful seeing young people taking initiatives.
0	cause well I dont know so mindyour own beeswaxs
1	That the  earth is getting better
0	we should bemre concious about what we eat and what impact or behavior has on our planet
0	if we don not protect our fish we will not have any more in the future

1	I dont like spending extra money but it is worthit to keep the seas healthy.
0	That the world is becoming a better place
1	je parle pas tr?s bien anglais mais je veux bien recontrer une ##### nana
0	otherwise we wont have any more fish!
1	Fishing stocks are being depleted faster than our ecosystem can cope
1	we should do all we can
0	we need to ensure supplies for future generstions both for rexretion and commercialneeds. I wantto know where the fish I buy comesfrom and is safe to eat
1	it is sustainible and sustainibeis isthe best
0	we should not eat more than we need
0	its an idea that can help save our planet
1	if you cantsupply meat sustainbly. don tsupply meat
1	it is important to act now for the future
0	too many fish species are going extinct or are threatened dueto overfishing or a lack of a food souce. we waste so much that itis unessassary for us to fish in this  way.
0	we had to safe our nature
2	cos as long as i get to eat goodtasting fish
0	we need to mke sure hat there ill be fish for a long tim. not just now
0	too much bulk buy put pressure on fisherman
4	Supermarkets should not sell fish at all in order to be more sustainable. There's no need for people to eat other individuals
1	We might actally have an opportunity to improve our past unsustainable wrongdoings.
0	cause its more morally efficient and helpful for the planet
1	companies should take resonsibiity and stop selling things that are obviously bad for us and the environment
0	even if it costs more the cost to humanity will be greater in the long run
1	i think itd be great but probs wouldnt work
1	that fish are inportant and we need then to help our animals and feed us
0	because fish stocks are precious and we need to protect them
0	i thnk that we need to make sure future geneerations have food
0	so there is fish left in the sea
1	we have to be responsible and have betterfarming practices
1	Because otherwise we will have no more fish in our ocen
1	supermarkt supply restricts options in good ways
4	i cant eat cheap fish fingers anymore
1	its important to protect our natural environment and animals
1	because the fish will not be extinct
1	i think its the first step in change
1	itsbetter for us and the enviroment
0	To help put an end to overfishing
1	because los of people would lose their jobs worldide but we need to switch our methos.think lcal actglobal.
1	it is good for the enviroment
1	eat as much as you need. minimize waste
0	its the right thing to do
0	hi im socooland ur not shame
1	Most fish tastes the same to me anyway
1	To save the world and the animals .
0	it is iportant to uphold the existing wildlife and protectit
3	the best course of action is to stop consuming all fish.
0	because only wild sustainable fishing sould be allowed.  we over fish too much ad it is not sustainable or ethical
0	its a good thing and nesassary
0	we need tovonly fish ata rate whereby the fish can sustainably repopulate
4	we should let fish duplicate and grow
3	somefish speciesare getting  extinct bexause of global warming
3	great idea but i live in the us
1	anything to keep the world health for the oceans and te ppl
1	i hope it resolves the issue of fish levels but fearitmay be too late
0	its a great way to raise awareness
1	if we dont do  it now the wildlive we know will collapse and we might end up with no more fish at all
1	the sea is emptying out  we should stop fishing the endangered species
1	The  key to a good balance is to reduce our consumption and purchase sustainable foods.
0	better for the environment and to let the fish recover
4	i think its bad because we are running out of fish
0	so people can get more foods
3	people will have no food because there poor not in a mean way
1	because we dont want all thefish to be shipped out
1	because fish are creature just like humans
0	its a great idea. or we could stop harvesting fish altogether.
1	supermarkets everywhere need to come up with creative solutions
0	I am exitedbut I think we shoulldn't be eating fish in the first place. As a vegan I don't see why anyone would eat a fish carcass. gross!
2	The fish cost more so people will not buy it
1	this is good for the planet overall
0	if we are to eat meat and fish we must make production sustainable and conditions of farming and cupture and hunane as we can. the animals have sacrificed their lives for ours. we must and can respect that and their own environments. we must be thankful and in tune with nature
0	we should use what is local and then visitors might get to enjoy our products and it gets sold abroar
1	i think that if this happens fish wont go extint
0	it would be a great step forwards
3	supermarkets dont care and lot of people just want cheap food
1	non sustainable fishing is absolutely daft
0	we should realise we are just passing through and we need to leave this earth the best it can be for future generations to pass by
0	fish stocks in te wid are depreciating. we have to be more respectful of our resources.
0	sustainability means a future for our children
1	Its better to pay more and have it forever than to pay less and potentially never have it again... Money has no value if there is nothing to spend it on!
1	why ould it cost more? lookibg after humans and earth should be our main goal in life and as species. Life in all aspects are always forgotten. why do we humans forget life....
1	it would be a better place
0	tired of crappy food nurrished by unproper way causing pollution and standardization all around the world
2	i just think this is bad2020
0	I LOVE FISH FISH FISH FISHFISH
0	that it is a very good idea and I hope it does happen
1	that we will find ways to live on other planets and also to save our earth
1	if you want fish go catch it #catchandcook
1	nz should have a six km fishing reserve around whole coastline
0	preserves fish stocks cost is what we hve to do to preserve
0	we dont NEED to eat fish. so we shouldnt be emptying the oceans.
1	we should be educating children skills such as fishing and hunting so that we can build a society that gathers their own food instead of bulk killing and buying from supermarkets.
1	supermarkets willdowhat they can to cutcosts
1	Because it is an ambitious goal but itwouldbe good if it happened
1	to ensure the future can enjoy the ocean
3	this is a bad idea. im very worred well run  out of fish.
0	everytung has to be susrainabe that we eat
1	I hope that this stops illegal fishing
1	sustainable is important. evrything we do should be sustainable
0	sustainability should beimportant to everyoneso future generations can enjoy the things we have enjoyed.
0	Without sustainability we risk making more species extinct and upsetting ecosystems.
0	depleted supply and terrible working conditions
1	i like fish. miss me with those fish fingers
1	sustinably caught fish are specifically caught. other fish or mammals are not caught up in the nets. i think there is a place for farm raised fish however.
3	i think people shoud stop eating fish alltogether. Although I agree that fish should be sustainably caught efforts to make it more sustainable may deter some people from abstaining.
4	i just want cheap meat lad.okay?
0	the alternative is nonsustainability and thatis unconscionable
1	we all deserve fish thathve been raised without environmental impact
0	stock fish pollute the local water and is cruel to the stck fish
1	humans are taking over the earth... not in a good way. sustainabiity!!!
0	Help long term fishig outputs and sustainability
1	i think this is a good step in the right direction however the most sustainable diet is going vegan and even being vegetarian is good
0	it'll help prevent fish species extinction and support good cause (and they'll still make profit by telling people tht they're doing it)
1	more fish for future genirations.Give fish a chance
1	I think such legislation might have a chance of passing in the next generation.
0	I think its worth a few extra dollars to protect our underwater creatures that get hurt while people use giant nets. Also it could reduce overfishing
0	i think the long term health of our marine eco system is more important than profit
0	i think its a grat idea  because  it support the wildlife
0	it is always great to be finding more sustainable ways and the earth's price is greater than any
1	we should  protect ourwildlife - all of it. it is a step for a more sustainable future
1	still hoping for some sustainable changes but not sure that it will happen someday.
0	It's so important to protect our biodiversity for future generations
1	hopeful that if supermarkets stop then it will reduce andeventually eliminte unsustainably caughtfish therefore helping to reduce extinctionof precious species.
1	hopful because it means that native and non native fish-and sea creatures- can hang arod for another generation
1	because we need to save our ecosystem
0	comercial fish is far to small
1	we need to start acting sustainably or we will loose what we have
1	so fish species can recover and wont go extinct
1	it will help the environment especially th oceans eco-systems. sustainablefishing means less over fishing!!!!!!
1	that this is a good idea.
0	the ocean cares for us and we hav to do the same. sustainability and kaitiakitanga are worth the price
0	If people want fish in thefuture they should do this!
0	if we only buy sustainably harvested kai moana twillallow stocks to replenish
1	if we don't consume resources sustainably we won't have any at all
1	SUSTAINABLE MEANS PROTECTING THE ENDAGERED SPECIES
1	we cant eat money. we should be making every effort to preserve the health and future of our oceans
0	we need to be more connected tothe consequences of our actions
0	whatever happens to prices doesnt matter as much as keep our enviroment running
2	I dont really know enough about this topic to havean opinion
0	its important for the survival of future generation
1	Because then the populations of all sealife have a chance to rguvinte and have a chance ofrepopulation so there is no lack of food for sealife and noone being selfish for money. there i be a decrease in fishingif there isa durastic decraese of income
1	i think to be sustainable we have to thik beyond the now and look to the future. if we start to be sustainable in Aotearoa including fisheries  then there will be hope for the future generations of NZ and the world :)
0	its important to make sure how we consume isgood for our fauna and flora
0	It has got to the point where these fish will cease to exist in the next thirty years. How is that not a point of concern than the price of said fish.
3	climate change. warming oceans. lack of seafood traceability. overfishing....too much.
3	it would be discrimanatory to lower income households who could be choosing fish over other high impact meats eg beef and lamb
1	I THINK THAT IF WE PEOPLE WERE  MORE CARFUL ABOUT OUR ENVEROMINT
0	we need to be eating wth moreresponsibilityfor the world we live in
1	that isteway it should be to  have more sustainable practices and habits
1	we save the planet while we can
0	because our fish are very important to our ecosystem and our economy and if we are not careful they will all be gone.
3	we should eat more rawfruits and vegetables
1	I think this is a real possibility and necessity
0	im vegan so i think no fish should be caught and sold
0	my whakapapa lived on this landlong beforethe white folk pillaged it
0	without fish the eco system in the ocean will break down
1	Fish should only be caught sustainably to prevent major disruptions in natural marine food chains
0	i thibk we need to change our ay of eatibg
4	Profit will always out weigh sustainabilty wake up
3	we are leaving our next generations with limited resources unless we do some changes now.
0	that people are starting to make a stand
0	it s necessary to protect woldlife
1	a policy about fishing  before its to late for your kids .about it sustainability is for every nation throughout the world has  to do .im getting towards 60 years of age .you the next generations need to pressure the worlds leaders to adopt such. fishing and farming polocies .
1	to keep fish stocks at a healthy sustainable level
1	we are overfishing moore sanctions against the large company or countries should be harsh
1	Because thrn thereeill be more fishin thesea and they wontbe endangered.
0	its just good.  i dont want things to be dead
3	let em die let em die! there are WAY to many fistin the sea!
0	because we need to protect our seas
0	we have to consider the future
1	we need  to prootect kaimoana for future generations
0	we need to protect all species esp if theyre near extinction
0	only makes sense.  too bad common sense is not common
0	that would mean thatthresonsibilityof sustanibilit will fall on big corps and they will also encourage local fisherman to get morre fish. giving back to economy and also creating jobs
0	If the oceans die so do we. We need to stop being greedy and careless.
0	otherwise there will be no fish left soon and no one benefits from that including the fishing industry
0	because we have done enough damage
1	We need to think of long term environmental solutions ahead of cost
0	i think we should save thefish
1	i think we should protect all fish
1	cause some places dont sell fish and i kinda think its a bad idea only what if someone waslooking for fish out in the ocean and they were very poor what happens thieri kinda hnk it a good idea because some people may not know to fish so then thy to the supermarket i dont know.yes
0	it should be the only option. Th?y sh®ld nt b? bl? to profit from rare species or risk their futures.
0	we need to preserve our kai moana
3	licontinue to live off the land and seaIn recent years we have seen the population of fish in New Zealnd waters steadily decline due to over fishing we need to find better solutions to tackle this problem so that our future generations can live off the oceans
0	i dont want to say why
0	i want an world my grandchildren can livo on and i want them to have the freedom i have now
1	i think we should all try and look after the resourceswe have
1	because its good for the future
1	i think it is unlikely but will improve enviromental stabiliy
0	if not its at the cost of our environment
1	im not hopeful that they will but i hope it does happen
0	I think the youth of today can already see the evidence of maladmnistration by their predecessors and will put in place the right policies to correct this travesty
2	i no care because i eat dolphin and shark
1	at least we are talking about the issue...
1	but what if not sustanibly caught?
0	people need to be more concious of what we are doing to the planet and the affects we have. we should do what we can to try to fix it because it was our faut in the first place. eat sustainably
1	consumers have the power to choose. with enough people demanding change there is hope for our world
2	im ## and dont gotta worry about groceries
0	we need to protect the fish
0	it gives the oceans time to rehabilitate and other species wont die.
0	So that the resources can replenish and  not becoe extinct and be more sustainable for future generations .
4	if you catch a fish it yours
1	this has the potential to make a difference
0	its a sustainable way of living. the ocean can only supply so much befre it runs dry. if we cut comercial fishing the wildlife would be able to thrive and we could build up populations before its too late
0	we should de-elevate the status of humans
0	this is good for the fish. Also this interface is dogshit. Go the AB's
1	large scale fish farmng is extremely detrimental to its surrounding environment!
1	it is important to maintain fish  populations so that future generations are still able to use this resource
0	i do not know modern technology
1	in hoping the idea is sccessful without excluding people from havng a chice
0	I think that it would be better for the envoroment.
0	better eat less fish but healthy and sustainable
1	to keep the plant fed and drive innovation without distroying what humatity has created
1	because it is more sustainablefor all.
0	providing sustainable options as common place help maintainhealthy ecosystems
1	its important for our planet and future generations
0	I THINK WE NEED TO SAVE THE FISHANOUBT
1	this is very important for teh future
0	there is no harm to us humans as we arent scarcefor food anyway. humans are greedy
0	bcuase ye earthlings nor protetve and stuff like us aliens
1	i think it is the way to go but we still have a long way to get there...is  it too late?
1	we can do it but need to get people to chane their expectations and behaviour
0	I think that we should be more thougtfulabout eating fish and meat. We always have to think about what has to be done for it and how it is done when you eat cheap fish and meat
0	because fish are friends not food
0	we have to think about the future. alsoyou do not need that much fish for their nutrishesvale
1	Eating fish hurts our environment. We have to reduce our consumption as soon as possible.
0	WHEN WE BRUSH OUR TEETH THE PLASTIC BRISTLES WASHIBTO THE OCEAN. THE FISH EAT THEM AND THE FISH END UP ON OUR PLATES
0	i think this is a good thing
0	include the full /real cost of the product. Not the cheaper price where the cost is transferred to the future generations
1	this is how fish shud be sold everywhere. if dont stop overfishibg now our ocean and rivers will soon be empty
0	because there is no option of buying new fishes in a supermarket once they are extincted
0	i would like my son to live in a world where we havent destroyed nature
1	price to consumers should also be reasonable so that people can afford it.
0	it is better for the environment
1	because the more fish gets bought the more gets caught  and to make more profit the nets etc...get bigger and so as a consequence more and more other little fish and seafood  bits are caught.
4	Governments have to agree to reduce fshing levelsand rationing selling of fish to consumer outlets.
1	yes because we dontwant allthe fish gone
0	we allwin and we already know it can be done economically.why wouldn t we?
1	cause we need toprotect te mara o tangaroa
1	we should look after our resoures
0	because fish are very importent to the seas
0	it is better for our health
0	fish is already expensive so what is wrog with paying a lil more for sustanable fish
4	my best friend is vegan name is ######### her numberis 1
1	itmean another chanse or ish to be ith next gnoations
1	i think feish stocks are being overfished and cultures who rely on fish as a major part of their diet will be severely affected by diminishing supplies
2	I dont know anything about this topic. People should rather eat less fish.
3	i want to be able to live my life without allnof th environmentalroblems affecting earth right nw
4	you shouldnt eat fish at all. kisses
1	i love seafood but want it to be sustainable
1	yes i want protect ®r fish
0	its good that weve finally woken up to this problem and now we can start to address it. humans aregood at adapting so we should use our skills for the futureofall species.
1	i dont support farmed salmon unless strictly regulated
0	retailers need to lead the way
0	change brings opportunity for human innovtion
0	wee need toperserve our sea liffe
0	In my opinion fish should not be caught at all unless absolutely neccessary. But by starting to only sell sustainably caught fish; I believe people will start thinking more about sustainability and their actions.
1	the planet matters more than convenience
0	we need to conserve resources for the future
1	we need to consider moderation and not exclusion of food types to maintain eqilibrium. i want everyone to enjoy the future
0	this is how it has to be done !
1	its a nice idea. hopefully humans will start to tnk more about the impact we have on the earththen money.
1	every little help and its so important
0	we  need to be kind to earth
0	its time westarted to listen to mother nature
0	our tastes shouldnt cost the planet
1	i would pay more worth preserving
1	people are more aware of sustainability
1	supermarkets are slow to respond to this reality
1	people should feel good about the eafood tgey are eating
4	Animals should not be consumed by humans.  ALL animals yes fish have a right to live their lives as god intended
3	you should keep track  of hosw muck someone catchies and penalizeeo HIM AS NEEDED
0	this will make a difference and should already be in place
0	it's the best museum of the world
3	people will  never beable to  effectively manage  there has t be  moratoreum achange to stop over fishing and consumption
0	it is the only solurionto over population
1	please save the planet for the grandchildren
0	because we need diversity inthe world and less waste
0	it is our only hope to save the wild
0	we cannot continue to plunder our oceans without consequence
1	its so important to preserveour natural resources
1	Price of food will always rise. By ensuring a sustainable fishery consumers are at least aware of WHY the product costs more rather than some arbatrary corporate prie hike.
1	SUSTAIN OUR PLANET AND THUS OUR LIVES
1	if it is the onl option n one will knowthe difference
0	we  should not be destroying the resources we have left in the wild
1	i agree. but hopefully theywouldnt be too expensive that they become a rare commodity
1	because the seas are under threat andwe need to preserve it for future generations
1	maybe we can help species to survive and to be more sustainable about our planet.
1	i  think we need to preserve our fish stocks in the sea
0	It's time for us to come to terms with the true price of the food we eat.
