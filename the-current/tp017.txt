1	.Done responsibly freedom camping should be okay but people from western societies clearly can't be trusted to do the right thing as history has shown countless times. Therefore this privilege should be revoked
4	99 PÄRCÄNT OF PEOPLE ARE RESPOSIBLE WHILE CAMING. there will always be a small group of people who are not resposible sotats not the right way. do more for education
4	A ban on freedom campers is blaming all for the mess made by a very few.  I dont agree that they are the ones creating a significant negative impace
1	A bit more regulation would ensure we're better kaitiaki of te taiao - most campers are respectful but some are not!

4	a few humans spoil it for the rest
4	a few idiots shouldnt spoil free access toour beautiful country
4	a few people ruin it for the rest (lots of freedom campers love and respect the environment)

0	a few spoil it for the many
3	a few spoil it for the many
4	a key part of new zealands tourism
1	A majority of freedom campers dont respect the environment and leave behind filth and bags full of trash. Thy even dump their rubbish in overfilled bins.
3	a minority are spoiling the experience for evryone. education combined with people understanding and assoxiatig withour environebt is surley a better opton
3	A MIX as its for kiwis to be able to enjoy responsibly but over tourism is damaging local areas
1	a safer environment fr native animals
4	A small group ruins it for the majority. Camping also creates awareness for the environment
3	a small minority are ruining it for the majority
3	Access is one of the ways to keep people aware and invested.
3	access to wild spaces is important and while the rubbish is an issue that needs dealing with a ban will just force people into more remote spots without actually stopping freedom camping
1	ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR CHILDRENS FUTURE
3	activities like camping make people enjoy and want to protect the environmen tin the first place.
2	add restritions. dont straight up ban it
1	afects environment areas when park up.  go to camp ground.
1	AHHHHH I'm over the moon!!! Immy is back in town. It made my blood boil when she was away!!!
1	all campers should be self contained
0	all these mugs polluting our oceans
0	all unlicensed camping should be banned
3	Allocted free camping is important but people need to be courteous to nature.
4	allow to be used   as long as respected
3	allowing people to access nature with their whanau is extremely important. to ensure the environment is protected there should be more access to rubbish and recycling bins across most frequented camping spots
4	allows people to experience nature without the price tag
3	alot of damage and paru is left behind.
1	A-lot of the people that do freedom camp tend to spend the littlest amount of money possible so all we end up with is less money in the economy and we have to clean up after them.
4	already too much restrictions and rigid structure.
0	although freedom camping is fun i love the environmentmore than camping
1	although many of us are sensible too many people do n do the right thing and gruin natu
0	Although the potental waste is negative. if itbwas better regulated it couldwork a lot better

4	ANGRY KAREN OWO SOSOSOSOS PRETTY AND OLD WAWAWA
4	Angry that some people are spoiling for others. NZ is beautiful and freedom camping is a great way to experience nature here. I think it should be banned to protect our environment but I'm mad that lack of respect for our land by some will cost everyone this experience.
1	anything tha t has a negative affect on the environment is  something that needs to be dealt with to ensure that the natural world survives into the future
0	anything to save the enviornment is exciting
1	ar least there is serious awareness of the pmroblem
3	AS  A RESECTFUL FREEDOM CAMPER  I WORRYTHEACTIONS OF A FEW WILL SPOIL WHAT WE HAV AVAIBLE TO US.
4	As a proud environmentally conscious New Zealander I strongly believe it is my right to freedom camp provided sites are used apropriately with self contained vehicles and onboard facilities. If we cancel it we'll just be another land for the rich denying our kids opportunities.
3	as a te araroa hiker i kbo that most people who do wildcamping dont leave behind rubbish and love nature as much as the people who want to protect it.people who spend their time out in the forests or bush love to b close to ature and dont want to cause any harm.
4	as a tourist who is resoectfulof thisland thats unfair to not be able to freedm camp
2	as lg as tgey dobt mke a mss
3	as lng as people respect the land there is noissu
3	as long as facilities IE toilets are comparable to provision to the localities.
2	as long as i can play league of legends i dont care
1	As long as its responsible. for example leave no trace.
4	as long as not on privite propaty sould be fine
2	as long as people are respectful of the environment
3	as long as people are responsible.
3	as long as people are responsible. we shoud be able to see the country
4	as long as people pick up their rubbish alll the time it should be allowed. freedom camping is a great expeirience for all and it should be allowed to find new enjoyers and enthusiasts.
2	as long as the mess is cleaned up it shouldnt be an issue
1	as long as there aare toilets and people use them propely. toilets need to be self composting.
3	as long as they respect the land
4	as long as we dont pollute and respect the nature i dont see why not
4	as long as we respect the whenua we should be allowed to camp freely
4	as long as wearerespectful of our whenua freedom caming should be allowed
4	as long as you do not poo its okay
4	as new zealanders growing up it was just called camping it did no harm then i have no idea why everybody has a bee in their bonet now the only reason i can see that people would complain is they are making no money out of it no harm is being done. to many rules.
1	as someone who goes camping in permitted camping areas I think that it is much better nd safer because peoples sites can be monitored
3	aslong as you clean your rubish it should be ok.
3	Avoiding building infrastructure means we need scapegoats for the implications of that avoidance. Public toilets and rubbish bins are scarce in NZ, itâs not clear why. Freedom campers have far less impact than cruise ships and banning them widens the wealth divide. Rich win again
3	backpacker bring a hugh economie for this country. if this areas are banned no body will comein nz
3	bad behavior from few people shouldn't constraint all of us. instead we should invest on pedagogy to learn everyone how to live with nature and respect it. otherwise we may remove people from city too due to human pollution..
3	ban ccamping and ban yyourkidsfrom being able to enjoy the real enviroment and put in aparkso that someone cangetrich
3	BAN isnt help for everything. people always find a way to do what they want. only if we truly care about our earth then it works
0	ban it. they bring nothing and take everything.
4	ban wealth hoarding and corporate control of natural resources
4	bannig is not a solution.There are smarter solutions...not every camper is a bad camper.
4	banning and removing freedom camping areas will not deter the irresponsible- but it will keep the responsible campers from seeing this beautiful country
4	Banning camping is only addressing the symptom of the issue and not the core problem of disrespect for the land and lack of education.
4	BANNING freedom camping is not the answer. So much of the rubbish and defication is done by motorists and local residents
4	banning freedom camping is not the solution. better education is. as long as people know the impact they have on naure they will respect it more. and going out camping and being close to nature makes you want to treasure it because you get to see & experience how beautiful it is
3	banning freedom camping may cause people to camp in protected or endangerd places.
4	banning freedom camping will negatively impact tourism and deter young jobless people from visiting the country. less backpackers equal less workforce in the farms. more facilities ( toilets; showers; bins; recycling bins ) would minimize littering and damage to the environment.
4	banning is anextreme. Fines and penalties show stop people from littering. People should be able explore nature
3	banning is limiting freedom. Stricter restriction on eligability is better
4	banning is not going to solve the problem. its a matter of better regulation and more accessible camping spots.
1	banning may be the only way to go in order to achieve a total waste free area. there are great monitored national park camping areas on offer.
3	banning wouldn help. you cant avoid it. people would camping anywhere anyway. controlling it is the way to go
3	bannning freedom camping seems to assume allcampers areirresponsible. make sensible restrictions on waste and rubbish but continue to allow camping?

2	Freedom camping should not be banned but only  in the circumstance that people start truely caring for the nature  and wildlife.
3	freedom camping should not be banned but rather fine those who litter
1	freedom camping should still be allowed. but campers need to take care of the environment. hope that there can be some kind of compromise.
3	freedom camping should still exist but the govenment and the council should enact stricter measures especially from overseas tourists that typically have less empathy towards conservation efforts
3	freedom camping shouldnt be band as is an oportunity to explore nature and experience the outside instead there shuld be waste control or something
3	Freedom camping shouldn't be banned. Better guidelines and facilities should be in place to cater for visiting tourists and travelling kiwis wanting to see the country. Nz has so much to offer but it's getting harder to freedom camp over the past 10 years. 
3	freedom camping spreads the knowledge of nature
4	freedom camping was my only peace in life if it gets banned ill be very agery
3	freedom camping wher toilets are is a part of growing up in AOTEAROA. But if people abuse it tre should be fines too.
4	freedom campingis fine if you dnt litter
0	freedom campingis gross like my bum
3	freedom capming is great as long aspeople respect the places they go im worriedthat oo many dont
4	freedom cmping helps us to connect with nature
4	freedom is less and less possible. respect rules. keep everything with you and everybody can njoy nature
4	Freedom is one of the things we live for. Too many laws may stop us having anything to live for.
4	FREEDOM IS THE ONLYGOOD THING LEFT IN THIS LIFE
1	freedom is what nz is well known for and why i love it. to experience nature.
4	freedom of travel is a basic right
4	freedom to act for the environment is a basic right. there is more waste left behind in the city centre every single night and that is not banned.
3	freedom to camp should remain a right
3	freedom to explore the landshuld remain free. This freedomcomes witharesponsibikity for kaitiaki
4	freedom. taking awayfrom classic kiwi summer etc andmaking travelling only for the wealthy
4	freedomcampersexploe and appreciatenz. theyshould do it right
3	Freedomcamping itself is not the issue; it's selfish campers. We shoud issue permits for camping and a DOC group should be established to enforce our exectations.
4	freedome camping can be in the respect of the environment. also it is a way to discover the nature. if we dont know what is necessary to protect such as the natur how can we ?
0	Freedon camping creates mess and waste that damages NEW ZEALANDS precious flora and fauna.  There are plnty of camp grounds for people to stay on all over the country. People should use these instead.
1	freedon camping is great to experience the out doors as long as  people clean up their mess and respect the the wild life
3	Freedon Camping is one of the best ways to experience NZ
3	frnot the solution... freedom camping should be allowed but campers should care more about our holy nature

3	get ev vans recycled or bio degradable packing. can be made better. not get rid off
4	getting people to experience nature in a posatve  way will encourage future generations to become pationate about protecting it. Introduce heavyfines for those not following leave no trace principals. commercial logging and aggriculture do far more harm. dont scapegoat campers
4	give them more infrastructure. nz is for everyone.
1	Given that enough affordable campgrounds are provided I like the idea and think it helps protect nature.
0	giving back to our whÄnua and protecting our native wild life and plants

3	how are people supposed to connect with nature if we ban one  of the best ways.
2	how dis it going to help
4	how else do you see and enjoy nature
1	humans and nature can coexist as long as we remember that Earthis not ours. We are just borrowing it
1	humans are  dirty animals and shoukd stay in their houses
3	humans are also animals that need wild time . but we need to learn to care better for the land as we do so
0	humans cannot be reled upon to take care of the earth
0	humans dont respect nature well enough
0	Humans have a huge impact on the environment but many people do not know or do not care. Laws need to be in place so that people cannot contine to destroy the environment just for their own pleasure. There are other more eco friendly ways to enjoy nature than free camping.
0	Humans have been showing bad behaviour. Freedom camping should be banned. should use camping grounds but perhaps make them more affordable so people can take responsability about the enviroment.
4	humans need to connect with nature
4	Humans need to experience the freedom of going where they want. To explore. To learn. There is more rubbish dumped around urban areas than rural. People need to be taught respect and appreciation of our environment not banned from iy

1	I  DO  NOT WANT ANYTHING TO DIE
2	i  thibk caming s a great experienc  that brings people coser to nature. i hope that people learn to respect the environment in the future so people can continue to enjoy freedom camping
0	i  think  we  should not go to school now AYAYAYAYAYAY :)
3	i  think that we should go camping but  we should not harm  the animals  living there .
2	I agree and disagree. Since i also dont camp i dont really care but i really love nature and animals so...
1	i agree lol vote green party
3	I am a responsible freedom camper
4	I am angry against these people whodid not respect the environement
4	I am angry because people are killing our native animals
4	I AM ANGRY BECAUSE WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE...MAKING OUR WHENUA LOOK LIKE SHIT
0	i am at my home town
4	i am beyond angry with this situation
3	i am currently travelling by freedom camping right now and i take care f the environment and love the freedom of freedom camping. i love the environment but i would be sad if it was banned
0	i am excited becuse im cool
0	i am excited for illegal activitied

1	i am hopeful banning freedm camping will help to rejuvinate the environment
1	I am hopeful that it will positively impact the environment.
1	I am hopeful to see the environment better cared for. However I am sad that freedom camping cannot continue with people being more respectful of the land.
1	i am hopeful we can save the birds as they were here before us
1	i am hopefull because peoplewillnot think the same
1	I am no sore what think exactly but it migth be a good idea
3	I am not excited for thisidea because i love camping. But i also love the enviroment.
4	i am pretty much angry and against this  because people should be able to camp freely
0	i am really excited about this cause i think this idea is super duper cool
4	I am very angry that this is trying to be a policy because without the idea of freedom camping. This will mean that the homeless will have no home at all and that is not fair. That is taking human rights away and that is inhumane
3	I am very worried that the effect of campers leaving rubbish behind is ruining are local widlife and i think that we should have some camping laws and    think that all camp sites should have a sign that reminds them to pick up their rubbish and belongs before they leave the camp
3	i am worried about dangerous rivers
3	I am worried because of the fires they can make a HUGE impacet on are planet. The smoke makes the anamails sick and has the same effect on me.
3	I AM WORRIED THAT LESS BACKPACKERS COME. WE NEED BACKPACKERS FOR FARM WORK OR ANY OTHER WORK
3	I am worried that some people might go bonkers about no freedom camping but I am also worried that if you let freedom camping to be allowed. People might leave rubbish behind or people might hurt nature and etc. So be a good sport about this desicion
3	i believe that freedom camping gives people the opportunity to enjoy our beautiful country but am worried that some people ruin it for the rest and dont respect the land. it should not be banned but more education and solutions
1	I believe the more people who considerthisland to be their's willtake advantage of this. This newproposal will help keep plastic outofour oceans and forests.
1	i believe thy should ban freedom camping in certain areas. freedom camping is good for people who have nowhere to   stay however there are those who disrespect it.
1	I believe we MUST care for our home.
1	i belive ts only natural toprotec nature
4	i camp for food to survive and worms uwu
2	i cant see how freedom camping is bad fo nature. litraly just camping!
3	i chose worried because caing in nz is a beautiful experience but it depends on if the people tenting respect and take care of the land and nature around it
2	I depends if they are being resposible
3	i did a doodooand it was really embarrassing t was so smelly andmushy
2	i didnt reador this i just picked
3	I disagree because people who camp learn to respect nature more and connect with it
4	i do freedom camping and i take all of my rubbish wih me. its sad that some othercampers are not doing the same.
2	I do not cere becauseit is not my probel
2	I do not know how freedom camping afects wildlife
2	i do not know what that means
2	i dont  now what that is
1	i dont agree with freedom camping. Peopleshouldstay in cmpinggrounds with appropriate facilities and support the local economy
1	i dont agree with freedon camping because it hurts the envoriment and nature
3	i dont believe freedom camping is the issue. the issue s lack of government support in those areas.  open freedom camping but with rubbish disposal areas and 24/7  toilets mske it eco freindly
2	I dont camp ever and the only time I do is in school situations so I dont really care much
2	i dont car who this irs senbs     i         am nt pay tax
2	I dont care abt the nviroent
2	i dont care because i dont camp
2	i dont care because it will b e betterforthe enviroment but thbn will be lesstourists
2	i dont care because its ok
2	i dont care because ppl wnt to camp and its fun but it is also bad for the enviroment so i will be happy with either choice.
2	I dont care cause it is not going to harm the enviroment but on the other hand i hate freedom camping/campers
2	i dont care cuz i donk care
2	i dont do camping so i dont care
2	i dont freedom camp so it doesnt effect me
2	i dont freedom camp so itdoesnt effect me directly but support most things that protect the environment. i think a button that said supportive would be a better option
4	i dont have money so i have to freedom camp
2	i dont know anyhing about it
2	i dont know enough about it
2	i dont know so maybe some of it?
2	i dont know what freedom camping even means lol
2	i dont know what freedom camping is
2	i dont know what freedom camping is
2	i dont know what freedom camping s or howit effects anything. hence i dont care
2	i don't know what i'm doing
1	I DONT KNOWI JUST PUSHED IT
0	i dont knw and i dont care
3	i dont like  camping i olny have been camping one time

2	i dont like camping so i dont care
2	i dont like camping. city girls up
2	i dont mind justto save the envroiment
2	I don't really care about yes and no. I care about love.
2	i dont really care as ong qas we can still camp
2	i dont really care because its your choice but just dont do something bad to the earth we want our to be healthy.
2	I dont really care because ive never gone camping and also because peole die by camping but people love camping so that makes me i the middle zone anyways i think humans need to stay where they evoluted to live and dont disturb the native anials. :)
2	I dont really care because only the few spoil it
3	i dont think campng and iving in natre is the issue here. its the plastic and wste tat comes from large corperations
3	i dont think freedom campibg is the problem for that
3	i dont think freedom camping has the biggest contribution to harm the environment compared to other activites.
2	i dont think it is a problem
1	i dont think it necessarily needs to be banned but more facilities should be provided in high use areas to prevent people causing problems
1	i dont think it should be banned but i do think stricter rules should be put into place. people lack the respect oflooking after our country and thats because thats because they can
4	i dont think it shuld be banned just make sure to give enough facalities for rubbish disposal
3	i dont think this will go down well with alot ofpeople but need solution to minimise waste anf save th environment
4	i dont wabt for people tobe bannedfor freedom camping because its justsad
4	I feel angry that freedom campers get the blame, let's educate, instead of removal. This applies to so many other like driving culture 
3	i feel as though the we should stead increase the amount and availablity of waste facilities such as  rubbish and recyling bins.
0	i feel excited because it will have a positive inpact on theenvironent
3	i feel freedm to accomodation is essential. especialy for those who lack financial access to costly accomodation.
1	i feel hopeful because this might help with reducing plastic
3	i feel like banning outright could potentially increase illegal camping as people could just. disregard the ban and risk it all for the fun. i think this could cause a public outcry of some kind
3	I feel like its imppossible to stop with out having too exterminate humans entirely
2	i feel like people like torrist shold be abke toe explorle our contery
3	i feel that freedom camping is an imortant thing to keep around. however i feel it needs tighter regulations around it to stop people ruining it for everyne.
3	i feel that we could extict a lot of animalsif we dont ban freedom campibg
4	i feel worried for the animals
3	i feel worried for the genorations ahead
0	i got to go on a plane
1	I hate it when people litter
2	i have know idea what it is
2	i have n opinion and i amarobotindisguiseheheheheheh
2	I have never really been fredom camping and if people do pick up their rubish its fine
3	i have seen rubbish and poop where no toilet is. the official places looked o .k i only met responsable people
0	I have seen so many disappointing things done by freedon campers. We camp all the time and believe campgrounds are the only way to go.  I believe the NZ economy will benefit by this decision also. There is a lot of free stuff in NZ already. Not everything needs to be.
1	I have seen Wanaka and waterways getting polluted with toilet paper lining the banks. Need some sort of action to keep campers accountable. Such as must have toileting facility on board or at camping location.
3	i have serious concerns about the environmental impact. but worrya ban willhave nonomic impact
1	i hink we should doeverything we can to help
3	i hope instead people will learn to respect the evironment so we can all enjoy it

1	i love campng; but i know to many who abuse the land. having restricted camp grounds and no free camping could help reduced the issue
4	i love caping it is so fun
3	I love freedom camping and dont think it should be banned but I like the environment too
3	i love freedom camping.the majority of campers respect the land so t should not be banned
3	i love freedom campingAND take my rubbish always with me
0	i love this place so much
1	i love you sid rico dad gem alia pran
4	i lovefreedom camping it brings travelers in and keeps people outdoors im here traveling nz because of freedom camping
4	i m a freedom camper and respect the enviroment. freedom camping is an nz right!!!
3	I m using this campgrounds. there are nice and let us see how nature can be. maybe we should ask a licence to use them and respect the natureas we can sleep there. i m worried because it would mean more big campings and i m nt sure it s a solution. free camps let us spread. thank
2	i need to do a no. 2
2	i never go freedom campin so i dont see how its relivent to me.
3	I ORDERED A BREAKFAST WHERE IS IT DID YOU EAT MY BREAKFAST I AM WOORIED THAT SOMEONE ATE MY BREAKFAT OH NOOOOOOOO
4	i own a van. please dont
4	i own a van. please dont do this to me
2	i really dont care at all
2	I REALLY DON'T CARE IF MY FAMLIY DISLKES ME
3	I really enjoy getting away from it all at the spur of the moment, and this would impact my camping options. But I understand why this is a solution, since unfortunately not everyone is respectful and caring about our environment.
1	I really hope everybody understabds that freedom camping is not just bing free t roan around because. You might her yourself or mother natue so I have hop that e do the right thing
3	i really like freedom camping lots of people can not afford camping grounds and they live in their car were are they supposed to go
2	I really like the idea of banning people from camping becaus its good forthe enviroment.685 ALL DAY
3	i really like to be able to choose where to   cap
1	i reallyhopes this happens beacause itkilling wildlife
1	i recognise thatwhile i practice leave no trace principles not everyone else does abd it is importabt to protect the environment
3	i skerd because ole the peapel don t care of the planet and animals we don t have a chose sory
4	i spent 5000 on a van to freedom camp in
1	i thibk if you are locals and respect theenvironmentitcan be okay. we should be able to travel and experience our land. although i think there should be more rules and restrictions to make it betterfor our planet
1	i thibk is bad cs imban alpha wolfer uwu ad like if u db thibk its goood i bbliey u. no good.
0	i thibk it should be banned to conserve the land for future generations
1	I thibk that it should be managed. I am hopeful that management willsolve the problems it creates. Ive seen the mess they leave behind and dont want disrespectful people having free rein and access without caring about what impact they have.
4	I thik people should be alowedto camp as long Äs Ä«t  dÅÄs nÅt ÄfÄct thÄ ÄnvÄ«rÅmÄnt.
3	i thin its a great way to experience new zealand aslong as the rules are set
2	i thing it is sometimes okay but thay need to protect the enviroment
1	i thing we need to rethink how we do freedom camping. Have it but not completly free
3	i think  there shoud be  proper places for people cam
1	i think a few ruin it for most people
4	I think about you all the time
1	i think after years of intensive freedom camping  we are starting to get policy in p lace to ensure it i s now a little more stustainableabd socily and enviromentally considered
0	i think all kararehe are super coooooll
3	I THINK ALL PEOPLE NEED TO RESPCT OUR LAND
4	I THINK BACKPACKERS DONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY  TO PAY FOR NATURE
4	I THINK BANNING THE FREE CAMPS WILL NOT LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF TRASH PEOPLE LEAVE BEHIND. WHAT ABOUT WE LOOK INTO SOME OTHER OPPIONS. WHAT WE CAN DO TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM RUINING THE NATURE ?. EG. WHATIF FREEDON CAMPS WERE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICENT EQUIPMENT LIKE RUBBIS BINS etc.
4	i think camping allows people to get in touch with nature and ultimately protect it more than damage it
4	i think camping is a nice way to get closer to wildlife unless you want it exticnt
4	i think camping is fun but its not good to leave rubbish and other things behid
0	I think camping should be limited because it could hurt the enviroment
2	i think camping should not be banned
3	i think campingisawonderfulway forpeople to connect withnature and learn to appreciate it
0	i think campings fun and exciting because you get to explore other things you didnt know about.
3	I think educated campers are more respectful to the environement than some people using other types of housing.
1	I think education is the wayforward. To remove this option is to destroy the enjoyment and envolvement of people in our natural environment
1	i think everyone who comes to new zealand should respect our lovely country.we dont destoy ither countries when we vist them.
2	i think free camping is fine
4	i think freecamp its a really nice way to visit this beautiful country
3	i think freedm camping if respectful of the environment can bring people closer to nature and have a greater appreciation of the bush. but i thÄ«bk Ä«t should be regulated in at risk areas
4	i think freedom caming is cool
1	i think freedom caming is stupid just go to a campsite like the rest of us and stop ruining the environment to fuel you rsuperiority conplex
3	i think freedom camping helps connect people to nature although penalties could mitigate negative impacts
4	i think freedom camping is a good way to see nz. more resources are neededthough
4	i think freedom camping is a great thing for tourists
3	i think freedom camping is a kind and generous thing that aotearoa offers so i dont want to see it go. but i care about our natural spaces more
3	i think freedom camping is a really good idea for visitor and residents because some people have trouble finding housing or don't have the means to rent. Also educating campers so that they are aware if their impact on the land can help everyone
1	i think freedom camping is a wate of our environment and weshould do more to protect it
3	I think freedom camping is fine as long as there is personal accountability. I dont think banning is the way to go
4	i think freedom camping is good.
4	I think freedom camping is ingrained in the kiwi way of life and the purest form of exploration our country can offer. Despite the fact it infringes on our BORAct and freedom of movement it also takes the ability of camping for the lower economic groups of society. 
4	i think freedom camping is the best way to explore your beautiful country. mabey you could make fewer but bigger areas where people is allowed to freedom camp?
1	I think freedom camping provides important and essential opportunities for people to connect with and learn about nature; so i am hopeful that education can improve freedom campng so it can continue
0	i think freedom camping should be band because it is bad
1	I think freedom camping should be banned insome areas. If peope fredom camp they might trample habbitats of endangered or recovering spieces. Camping is good fun but if you don't take the right precautions (like cleaning your gear and being careful where you setup) you're not ok
3	i think freedom camping should be continued. people just need to take more care of our country
3	i think freedom camping should be kept to promote affordable travel and investment in autearoa. And ther are more contructive and inclusive solutions to eliminate waste from our environment
4	i think freedom camping should be permitted. There should just be bigger fees for leaving rubish.
1	i think freedom camping should be regulated to minimise pollution
3	i think freedom camping should not be band bc its a free contrey
3	i think freedom campingcan existwithmore awareness aroundrecycling and waste management as well as morerubbish bins and more recyclable products.
3	i think freedom campings regulated should be the future.
4	i think freedom campng shouldnt bebanned bcause its saves money as some campsitesare really expensve :)
4	i think freedome camping allows us to apreciate nature and nature directly improves our mental health which we all need to boost
1	i think further ollution needs to be stopped
4	i think humans should stop controlingthings like this.  we are not that important nor here for long enough to worry about shittingin the woods
2	i think i need a nap
0	i think i really love my vacations wellington and love the company of my brother and sister in law
1	i think i will be the best sister in the world
1	i think if it helps the environment improve and endangered animals are able to strengthen then i hope it works
3	i think if people can clean up after themselves  this could be ok!
2	i think if they are not hurting the enviroment it is fine
1	i think if we have freedom campers they should pay an environmental tax suchas they do in many european countries. this would encourage possible campers to look at other sustainable travel options ..as freedom camping wouldnt be entirely free...an put money into more loc
2	i think if youre responsible to drive you should know how to clean up after yourself
3	i think ifthere were bins putin place  itwould save alot of issues withpeople caming
3	i think in one hand people must know their impact and respect the nature. in other hand ministry must educate people and include restruction in bad situation. area for camping must excist
4	I THINK INTERCTING WITH OUR WHENUA ON A PERSONAL LEVEL DEVOID OF SECULAR AND MONETARY INVOLVMENT WHEN DONE IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING  OF THE MAURI OF OUR WHENUA AND OUR CONNECTION TO IT
4	I think is an important nature experience.
3	i think is good to ableto e njoy the nature like we used to. however it is our responsability to protect it and not damaged it
4	i think it  should  be  allowed  with rules in place
3	i think it better to educate more the peopleabout  the weakness of the environment but in new zsaland when we go in a lot of free camping thereis no toilets no trash and its pitty becausemajoritary people are responsible and care about the nature so dont cancel the camping
1	i think it can be a big enviromental impact
3	I think it can be dangerous
1	i think it could be fun
3	I think it is  important for nature appreciation
1	i think it is a good idea for the cause of the situation so others dont have to deal with other people rubbish. looking after our  environment will increase a more healthier atmosphere for animals and humans in this God given earth. nga mihi kia pai to ra

3	i think it is good to have freedom campings
1	i think it is important to protect our nature and our earth. we only have one and shuld care more about it than hobbies of people. we should not disturb the animals our leave rubbishin the nature just for our own pleasure
1	i think it is not essential
3	i think it is very sad
3	i think it means tht experiencing nature becomes less accessable to young kiwis.
0	i think it might makethe world a better place for the sea animals
3	i think it needs to be managed
1	I think it shoud be limited but not banned completely. It's important to give people the opportunity to see the beauty and value of nature but we have to be resonable about how much we expose nature to our bad habits.
0	i think it should b banned cuz they ellv behind rubbsh and litter
4	i think it should be allowed so people can explore our beautiful country
3	i think it should be aloud for  familys to go canping and have fun where ever they like i am worried because i love camping with my family as well as my friends

0	I think it would be awesome for camping to be banned!
3	I think it would be more efficient to educate people rather than forbid them to discover nature and live in harmony with wildworld
1	i think itis a nice idea to protect the enviroment. maybe its possible to create special places for campers
0	i think itis good tostop freedom camping!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	i think its  a great way to explre nature
4	I think its a big part of NZ and shouldn't be banned. It should rather be controlled better and rubbish/dump stations should be provided.
0	i think its a good thing for it to be banned
0	i think its bad because birds and animals  have to move from their homes and leave and if you have a fire then it might be a hazard
1	i think its good that we are making change
3	I THINK ITS GOOD WITH FREEDOM CAMPING
0	i think it's important to preserve our environment so we have to make sacrifices
1	I think its importantto look after our enviroment as it looked after us for millions of years.
4	I think its just a wat to charge people for nature
3	i think its new zealand s duty to provide rubbish bins and facilitate travelers recycling also by providing clean facilities. it is shocking to constate the state of facilities and the lack of rubbish through the country
4	i think its sad how theydo that in our country
0	I think its the way to go  tino ora i te whenau
1	i think its worth paying a small amount so theland is taken care of
1	I THINK ITSHOULD BE ALLOWED IF YOU CAN PROVE UWOBT LITTER
3	i think itshould be banned in some areas but not all. it does alot for the economy in regards to tourism but also endangers our home...
3	i think kiwis should beable tocamp resposible in own country
4	I think Labour and the Greens can kiss my ass and I think law-abiding kiwis should be able to go camping with their friends and family yes.
4	I think lots of local people litter and don't treat our enviorments correctly. I lot gets blamed on freedom campers. I know freedom campers who pick up other peoples rubbish
3	I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE  DONT CARE ABOUT OUR INVIORMENT SO ITS INMORT TO CARE
1	i think me and my annoying brother will have a amzinag school holidays
4	i think me and ryous should get back tg
3	i think more education nature respect would be a better idea !  prevention first :)
1	I THINK MOST PEOPLE PARTICULARLY INTERNATIONAL VISITORS LOOK AFTER OUR WHENUA. ALL REGIONS/councils should have camping ambassodors
1	i think nature is more beauiful when we interact with it intentionally
3	i think nature should beaccessible to all people of any econmic ststus as long as they can respect the land
4	i think new zealand is a country for travellers and theres no other way to fell this close to the nature
4	i think newzealand should stay a free country so we should allow fredom camping but hevier fines can be introduced for littering and unnecesary destruction of the enviroment
0	I think other solutions rather than a blanket ban could be explored
3	i think ou are the pooof my DOG
1	i think our environmentis most important andneeds to be protected. but that is onlya very small part...industry. plastics. emissions. fuels. way of life. every bit matters -  we need more sustainability
3	i think people are getting more and more thoughtful about being environmentally friendly and sustainable towards the beautiful nature
4	I think people make camping do that to be near the nature and often respect nature. I have seen many people who stay in the hotel not respect nature during walk.
1	I think people may camp in an animals home and destroy it
3	i think people need to be better educated about the damage they can unintentionally do and how to better coexist with nature.
4	i think people should be able to develop a love of nature by experiencing it first hand
3	i think people should be able to enjoy the wilderness for free
3	I think people should be able to experience our environment by freedom camping but they should be taught how to respect and care for it so that other people can experience it just the same.
3	I think people should be able to travel freely
4	i think people should be free to camp as long as nature is respected and good infrastructure is provided. giving access to nature is the best way to protect it
2	i think people should camp if they want
4	i think people should clean up after themselves because their actions are impacting all.
3	i think people should respect the environment
2	i think people should take their rubbish home with them & dispose of it properl.
3	i think people will eventually come tothe realization that its in everyones best interest  to keep the land clean so that all can use and enjoy it safely
3	i think people willavoid camping if you have to pay and thay will sit at home produsing more rubish.
1	i think places have already started banning freedom camping
3	i think sleeping on public ground peacefullyis fine.
1	i think society would benefit greatly from reducing. reusing. recycling.
1	i think society would benefit greatlyfrom reducing. reusing. recycling.
3	i think some people cant afford campsies and so will not be abletogo camping anymore
4	i think some people care more about themselves ratherthan theplanet thathas given us a home
0	i think tat you should get a permit to freedom camp
1	i think that  this museumis cool!
1	i think that all native birds deserve to live
1	i think that all people  should be deucated before camping and know only to leave your foot print and nothing else
1	I think that although its fun to go pich a tent in the middle of nowhere I think its better to stick to the camping grounds that are for us cause they have actul loos.
2	I think that as long as you don't leave any rubbish or anything which wasn't there before and leave the space exactly how you found it, it should be okay
1	I think that banning freedom camping is a good thing.
3	i think that bannng t all together is not a great idea  finding other solutins to improve the situation as well as keeping the activity alive
1	i think that birds should die
4	I think that camping is a cool thing. why should it be banned
4	I think that exceptions should not be taken as a rule
3	i think that freedm camping shuld have boundries
0	i think that freedom campers litter with human waste which encourgages others to also litter in the wild
1	i think that freedom camping can be done well. We just need toleave the place as we found it.
1	I think that freedom camping helps morepeople learn about nature
3	i think that freedom camping is a big part of experiencing new zealand and would negatively affect many people
4	i think that freedom camping is a way toget ur mind off things and to see cool nature u cant see in otherplaces
2	i think that freedom camping is vvvvvveeeeeeerrrrrrryyyyyy fun
1	i think that freedom camping should be banned because by camping where-ever youlikeyou are disruptingvnimals and plants.
1	i think that freedom camping should be banned because it allows people to ruin nature and it can cause danger to wild life animals and can cause water pollution.
0	I think that freedom camping should be banned people harm the enviroment
3	I think that freedom camping should not banned but should be tightly regulate say a fine if they live rubbish behind and cameras in some of the most used areas.
4	i think that freedom camping should stay because we have the freedom to  make new friends look at nature and enjoy time away
1	I think that freedom camping shouldbe controlled since people can pollute the environment
3	i think that freedon camping shouldn't be banned but i think there should be negative consequences for leaving a mess. for example fines/bans
4	i think that if a freedom camper leaves rubbish or anything other than tyre tracks then they should be held acountable but we should be able to sleep were we need.
4	i think that if there is no freedom camping then people will be mad and i think that sinc i am 100 years old i dont care
0	i think that if this happens it will be cool
1	i think that if we as a collictive workhardwe will be able to form a better future
3	i think that if we don't care for our enviroment then we might die.
3	i think that iflaws are placed and nforced thenn freedom ampingsshould be allowed
1	i think that in the future people will know how to change it
3	i think that is a great way to see country places in NZ. Most freedom campers are well behaved and give back to the towns they stay in.
3	i think that it good but it limits where people can camp and thats no good we should all have freedom
1	i think that it is a amazing idea
1	I think that it should be banned because it is harming animals
4	i think that it should be banned becuz if you start a gas and u accidenly light a stick on fire thenu blow but it cobs back the fire will spred to trees and bushes so i think it should be banned
0	I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE REGULATED
1	I think that it would let the nature restore
0	i think that its a good idea becus peple
2	i think that its fine to freedomcamp
4	i think that its god to go abd see nature itself while sharibgtheenviret with bew zealabds native ani
3	i think that it's too bad that people can't be respectful... that leads to this kind of rule that reduce liberty. but maybe now because of climate change we have to reduce our liberties. it's a complicated question
4	i think that not all freedom campig shous be banned but more strictly monitored
4	I think that people are now destroying the enviroment more than ever just to mke useless things which I thik iscomepletely stupid and harming enivroment TO MUCH!
0	i think that people cqare not enough about environement and feel not responsible for their own garbage
2	i think that people dont mean to reck the nature iintentionaly they just like to spend time with whanau (:
3	I think that people dont take care of nature good enough
1	I THINK THAT PEOPLE MAY CAMP IN AN ANIMALS HOME AND DESTROY IT.
3	I think that people need t clean up after they camp
4	i think that people should be more educated about the enviroment and capsites should all have bins. as someone who is currently camping it has been very hard to find somewhere to put rubbish. more bins provided across the country would stop people littering as much
1	I THINK that people should look after the Earth better or all of the native animals will be gone!
3	i think that peopleshould be more responcable for themselfs
0	I think that Te Papa is very fun!
0	I think that TePapa is AWESOME!
4	I think that the environment should be protected at all costs because the environment is also our home too.
4	I think that the final boss of ohio is trash at fortnite
4	i think that the goverment should put up a rule that says Iyou do not put your rubbish in the trash you will get a fine.
1	i think that the motivation behind this movement is definitley right but freedom camping is so enjoyable it will be difficult to give it up
2	i think that the people agree with freedom camping should be allowed to camp but the people who dissagree( which is probably a majority) can  just camp at camp grounds
1	i think that there might be a change
3	i think that there should be demcracy and limiting this lessens it
2	i think that they will not care about te trib and go by thereself
0	I think that this is a good thing because then the wildlife can reclaim their land and wont eat the rubish left by us.
1	i think that this needs to become a problem and someone needs to do something. ithink this is a probem that we as a contry needs to dealwith
1	i think that this will be greatfor our environment as well asprotectibg our animals
4	i think that this would be bad for the enviroment because it can scare the ntive animals away and they can lose their hmes
1	I think that we need more bins and toilets
1	I THINK that we need to protect whatwe have left.  People do respect unless theyareinformed
1	i think that we should banned camping because some caampers litter
1	I think that we should either impose stricter rules or just ban it
3	i think that we should kee camping but people will have to add some rules
0	i think that we should leave the animals alone in theirhomes because you wouldnt want a weird lookng creature barge into your home especially if the creature is bigger than you and the plants can be poisonous if yu canpfreely
3	I think that we should let the freedom camping 'cause people who lives in camping cars sould not pay to stay sleep somewhere.
3	I think that we should try harder to pick up our rubbish but I do not think that freedom camping should be banned. It is fun and very soul lifting it is also calming and educational.
1	i think that when freedomcampers come onto natural lands they leave behind a environmental footprint that is badfor the environment if we banit the environment wont get destroyed
2	I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD DO LESS CAMPING IN THE WILD
3	i think thatfreedon canibgs cobtributing to our litter problem
4	I THINK thatpeople need thefreedom of outdoor ÄctÄ«vÄ«tÄ«Äs bÄcÄÅ«sÄ it has a healing affect on your body and being enclosed is not that healthy!
4	i think thatppl leave behid waste and rubbish regardles and banning freedom camping wont make a worthwhile difference. it would be more beneficialto focus on plastic reduction
3	i think the answer requires nuance. it has a lot of benefitsbt do agree it should be properly regulated
4	I think the country is too beautiful too put up such restrictions. Instead fines for polluting should be higher and people shoud get educated on how to camp sustainably.
0	i think the environment is impotant and ushumns shouldnt desriyi
1	i think the envoiroment should be a better place . the grass wont die
4	i think the giverment make too many restrictiins already. education is key.glyphosate which is in roundup and 1080 cause huge problems as do plastics. freedom caming is a beautiful way for people to truly apreciate the enviorment and taking tie away from screens and the fast pace
4	i think the government should stop attempting to control behavoir and focus on educating peopleto enjoy the environment
1	i think thepreservation of the earths natural wonders andresources is rewadng for mankind as well as the other equally important beings in nature such as wildlife and biodiversity
4	I think there ar bigger contributers to environmental degradation than a few irresponsible tourists. Like irresponsible multimillion dollar industries.
4	I think there are better ways to rotect the enviroment to prevent people from camping where they wish
3	i think there should be campingspots where people have to pay for example 10 Dollars per vehicle and therefore are provided with bins and toilets so its still possible to travel with a small budget
4	i think there should be cctv in all parking areas and number plate reader so this can be monited and big fines or permits that can be follwed
3	i think there should be free/cheap dedcated places to camp in this beautiful nature
0	i think there should only be  dedicated areas for camping to protect the environment.
2	I think they can camp! WHY NOT?!
4	I think this   because it ruins our enviroment
3	I THINK THIS IS A NEGATIVE APPROACH. I EXPERIENCE NEW ZEALAND AS A VERY CLEAN COUNTRYAND CONSCIOUS PEOPLE. IF YOU POINT OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING IT CLEAN AND HAVE A HIGH FINES YOU CAN STILL ALLOW GOOD PEOPLE TO BENEFIT FROM NATURE
1	I think this is good idea because people will leave trash and just this little change can affect the enviroment a lot! Thats why its a good idea.
0	i think this is really exiting and a good idea
0	i think this should be implemented ASAP
1	I think this will help natve nz wildlife thrive in a totaly undisturbed environment.
1	i think this will keep nz clean and protect the native birds
1	i think this would be a very good iniiative. i just hope that eople will respect it and do their part to protect the environment
0	i think thoughtless touristspolluted our waterways a long time ago
3	i think thre is a way for freedom camping to bring people closer to nature
4	i think tht peope should beableto have with native bush andbirds
4	I think to freedom camping is the only way to really experience the true beauty of this country. Of course everyone needs to stick to the rules!!
0	i think today is the best day ever because of cailean
1	i think we ae starting to appreciate the enviroment more than our selfish needs
3	i think we are out of time
3	I think we can regulate it on a better way. But its important for the people to live in contact with nature as it always been
1	i think we can teach the freedom campers better behaviour. Besides  MBIE are not known for independence in their surveys...
0	i think we cant relieon people to respect nature by not polluting it
1	i think we hould help as much as possible
1	i think we need to be careful of our footprint in areas of low use to keep them pristine.
4	I think we need to educate people more so we can all enjoy our nature without detrimental effects.
1	i think we should all try to be a little bit hopeful and maybe and things might go you way
4	I think we should be able to Camp
4	I think we should be alowwed tocamp whever as long as we are mindfulof the enviroment
1	i think we should do whatever we can to protect the environment.
1	i think we should help our planet
1	i think we should look after our nature
1	i think we should only camp in  places were theres lees animals
0	i think we should put up more rat traps :)
1	i think we should respect our environment.
4	i think wellmanaged freedom caming brings people closer to nature
4	I think you need to not punish the majority for the behaviour of a few. give people the responsibility to act in a way thatprotects the environment and facilitate this with education and facilities as needed.
4	i think you should keep freedom camping cause its fun
3	I think...there's not a one rule. Freedom camping as it means is fine. It's the ones who don't care. Be a shame to ban and responsible people suffer and loose the enjoyment 
0	I thinkall caming shoul b banned because camping sucks
4	i thinkdestry is minupilive and a fat whore
0	i thinkpeople  need to beabletorespextthe  evvirnment
3	I thinkthat education can solve this if there is signs of freedom camping causing pollution.  New Zeaand is a beautful country and feedom camping allows people to explore its nature
1	I thinkthat the numbers of people engaging in freedom camping without proper gear and facilities is unsustainable.
1	i thinkthat ut should be banned in certain tyes of places bt we still shoukd be abe to camp in somesafe envuroments
3	i thinkthatpeople shouldick up their rubbish and not leave litter. freedom camping isa amazing way to embrace natre ifyou are able torespect it
1	i thinkthis because it i wong to heart the environment for yourown  pleasure
2	i thinnk people shld b ducated instad
4	i thnk that while we need to be extremely careful there should be some places to freedom camp. this way as long as peope are respectful we can all be happy
4	i thnk they should know how toclen up after themselves
3	i tnink we should respect th invorment the way it respects us
3	I travel around NZ by freedomcaming myself and its a great opportunity to appreciate and experience this unique nature. We are all grateful to do so. Thats why we never leave any waste.
3	I understand why this is being considered as  oo many tourists have behaved poorly but it's sad for those of us doing the right thing.
4	i wanne be innature. but of course i have to carryall my rubbish out. nature is for everybody. we just need to behave in a good respectful way.
0	i want all people to  help animals
3	I want the environment protected butdont want to lose the freedom
0	I want the future gneration to live in a healthy enviroment
4	i want to experience ebvitonment and showkids so they are passionate
1	I want to have the ability todoit. but it is better for everyone to not. the environment comes first
0	I want too see all our amazing things
0	i wish i had a big penis
3	I WONT BE ALLOWED TO CAMP  AT A CAMPGROUND TOGO TRAMPING
1	i wont get sick alot next year
0	i would hope freedon caming could still exist with apropriate facilities provided
3	I would like everyone to have the opportunity to experience nature here.
4	i would like to go out with friends
3	i would like to retain access to wild places in nature at an affordable pricepoint. if people cannot afford to be outside in nature they cannot connect with nature therefore they will not see the value in conserving it.
3	i would not be here bc all other ways too expnsive for a travler like  me
0	i would rather have a healthy environment than people happily stuffing things up.
3	iam here by camper from germany and love the nature. also my 6 years old doughter learn so much from here
4	I'd CELEBRATE life's simple pleasures. I                                                APPRECIATE- OH JEEZ! It's a CIRCUS! J-j-j-j-just keep moving!
4	ID LIKE THE FREEDOM CAMPING TO STAY BUT  EDUCATE  PEOPLE HOW TO LOOK AFTER THE ENVIRONMENT
1	idk what freedom camping is so i just put the one everyone else put
4	idont see the problem if there are toilets and people take theirrubbish with them. it uses less resources than hotel rooms for accomodating guests
0	if  you lovethe planet yÅÅ« mÅ«st tÄkÄ prÄcÄÅ«tÄ«ÅnstÅ cÄrÄ fÅr Ä«t
1	If banning it preserves the environment because people cant follow simple rules and be considerate then i am all for it
4	if campers are hed accountable for their waste and take proper actions to be environmentally friendly then theres no reasonwhy they shouldnt be able to enjoy it
3	if campers respect the land we shoud allow freedom camping. look at way to teach and educate campers
3	if done correcty it is an awesome way to explore feel and respect the nature.
1	if done right it may positively impact our environment
4	If done sympathetically it encourages people to respect the environment
4	if done well it provides many tourist dollars to be sent on conservation efforts
3	if evryone was resosible and leave onlyyour footprints and litter or human waste
4	if free campers leave no trace itsfine. do not disconnect people from neature!
4	if freedom camping is banned  then too should any camping or tourism. ban travel too
0	if humans arent in nature we dont care about it so accessibility is moreimportant than local ecosystem quality
3	if humans take waste with them there is no issue
1	if it can help and change the actual situation...
1	if it helps we have to give it a try
1	if it helps. we dont need to take more from nature
0	if it is negatively impacting the environment it should be banned
0	if it is not banned than it will be bad
1	if it protects the environment then i'm in for it
0	if it wasa perfctwordeveryoewiuldikx uaftrbthrdekvsadevrythg  woukd be fbe. butit bt. bd peoplelittr. sofeedm cmpoing must be stopped
0	if it will help our wildlife we should do it
4	if managed properly like in whangaei it provides a unique opportunity to our guests annd also ourlower income whanau... our beautiful country should be shared by all...it is our duty as gaurdians to ensure it is kept clean....thats what rates for
3	if more rubbsh and waste infustructure were addedit coukd work
3	if no designated spots avaikabe people oud cmp anywhere  .make sure theres bins and toilets and trust the people
3	if only people could learn to respect theenviornmentand leave no trace. Freedom camping would be such a sad thing to loose.
0	if only people took responsibility for their footprint there would be a chance but unfortunately some few ruin it for everyone
4	if peaple go camping they will sart to earn something about it and starts tolike and apresheaded it. so they will start to protect the nature thts very inportend. peaple and nature shoud live together
3	if peope camp responsibiy they should be alowd. though i realise this may be had to police
3	If people are camping I would hope they cared about the enviroment. The idea that people dont--to the extent of needing to ban it--is worrisome.
1	if people are encouraged to clean up after themselves and help protect our environment
4	if people are responsible it should be allowed
0	if people cant be responsible then they should be prevented.
4	if people cant go outdoors how will they learn new things
3	if people dont put wste it is okay
1	If people have enviromently equipmenthen it is okay but if they do not then they need to buy some. Be good for planet earth so we can live longer.
0	if people how respect to the environment all good but so many freedom campers do not
0	if people leave their rubbish in the enviroment and stuff they obviously are evil little buggers abd shouldnt be on this planet
1	if people were better behaved and left nothing but footprints it would be better. but our reliance on unprepared and unguided tourists in growing numbers gives me pause. still freedom camping is amazing. better than a ban would be a mandatory course and license.
4	if people were responsible and respectful while freedom camping it is something that coukd continue
4	if peple ar e resonsible there is no problem without freedom camping there will be less tourists and they keep the country going
4	If peple would just use common sense and clean up after themelvs it would be fine. certain people ruin itfor the rest
3	if ppl are responsible and look after the environment it shuld be allowed
2	if selfcontained there is no problem. locals leave a bigger mess
2	if the campers respect the nature is no reason
2	if the campeur take care it  will be ok
1	if the freedom campers culd pick up after themselves it'd be fine but rn they cant be trusted; can they?
4	if the issue is waste control then deal with that issue directly.
3	If the people at thecamp site were to make a fire. And it could cause a big fire and could damage the environment. Lots of camping sites have a rule were there are no fire at all.
1	if the person is near facilites or has their own then the it  is better as long as they clean up after themselves
1	if there culd be moreeducation that wouldbe good. otherwise there should beon the spot fines to deter people from behaving badly
1	if there is a problem we should fix it
3	if there is punishment when you leave behind trash it should be okay again. via DNA Tests
1	if there were areas set asde forcamping less people would freedom camp
3	if there would be no freedon sites people WILL go elsewhere to camp. so its best to keep it in certain areas. there will alwaysbe tourists and NZ needs them. so why not make it convenient for both.
3	if they dont clean up they shouldnt be allowed
1	if they respect environment  it  will be round for future generations
2	if u want to do it do it if ur agents it dont be  kare let them be
3	if we all respectthe environment i belive everyone should have the right to experience and enjoy all that nature has to offer. itsimportant for us all to be able to learn and experience nature first hand
1	if we cant protect it with current measures we shouldban what harms it o r teach peoplet to care for our home. honestly im just glad its a discussion
3	if we keep banning it tourists will do it secretely. that will NOT help the environment. do better control of what poeple are doing. if they dont respect their surroundings give them a hefty fine!
3	If we make a law to help the enviorment and make sure people dont leave litter then it will be ok.
4	IF WE START TO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO CAMP EXPLORE AND ADVENTURE WE WONT HAVE AS MUCH FUN
4	if we stop freedom of movement and exploring.. when will it stop
4	if wetakecare of thenature freedom camping is cool and you can see incredible places
1	if you cant clean up after yourself you dot get to camp! its not hard
3	if you clean up ater yourselves tgere wont be a pblem g
3	if you don't allow people to experience nature wwhy would they ever apreciate it enogh to care hathappens to it?
3	if you learn to appreciate nature you are more willing to protect it
4	If you managed the freedom camping better this would not occur.
3	if you want to freedom camp you should be required to donate to organzations that protect freedom camping areas
4	if you wantto you nshould be allowed to fredom cam
3	Ifeel people should pay moreattntion while they freedom camp
4	ifthe campers are respecting the nature it should be accepted
1	ihope we can recover this world soon.it is so amazing and this may be our last chance at life
1	IIfreedom camping is a fun way for tourists and locals alike to see NZ. But the issue arises when people aren't responsible. They leave rubbish and don't care for the environment as they go. It either needs to be banned or hold stronger restrictions/control to protect our nature
4	iisif trash is the issue and a lot of trash comes from packeging maybe we need to change somethig about those instead or change the trash system meaning diffrent cans or hows its collected also freedom camping brngs a lot of tourists sonething that nz economy is depended on
0	I'm  so excited that the Horse has qÅ«Ä«t
4	im angry that people dont care enough about nature that a ban is being considerd. we should be able to freecamp without impact if everyone did it properly
2	im cool awesome and nice ;-)
0	im excited  because my grany is here
0	im exited becuase the invitronen is cool
3	i'm extremly scared for the future of the individual Imogen!
3	im feeling a little worried. i dont go camping i just have anxiety. actually i went camping in year 5 and it was the most uncomfortable experience of my life. they made us use towels instead of pillows.
4	I'm gonna KILL that thing! Mugman NO! It's a BABY! It's not a BABY! It's EVIL................
3	Im having nghtmares because of MR MIDNIGHT everyone here needs to RUN FOR THEIR LIVES
1	Im hopeful that freedom camping will be banned if it has a negative impact on the environment.
2	im neutral because there is a bad and good side to each opinion
4	im not angry but i dont want it banned but there needs to be better education and facilities and managemnet to minimise impact on the environment
3	im not angry or woried i am calmly opposedto the idea. why only negative options to oppose banning freedom camping? humans belong IN NATURE
2	im not much of a camper
2	Im not really to worried about this but i dont think there should limits
4	IM REALLY MAD BECAUSE OF YOU
3	im scared of campers if u know what  i mean
4	im soooooo angry at these campers
0	I'm super pumped for Waitangi day! I'm going to the Whanau film night near Te Papa!!
2	im sure how to feel   about this.
3	I'm very worried about the damaging affects this can leave on our local forests. We should create some strict camping laws to make sure our native animals and wilderness is left unbothered.
3	Im very worried that campers feal like they can leave plastic at campsites instead of putting it in the rubbish i think that this should be taught in the local schools of wellington and that veryone should respect this and go check out city dentist clinic my mom works there
1	im with my friends and there allwase bymy  side
3	im worried about people not having homes to live in so they have to camp in public places.  theydeserve to live somewhere.
3	IM WORRIED BECAUS THERE IS TO MUCH VIOLANCE AND WE ARE GONNA GET HURT
3	im worried for the backlash that will occur.. i also dont think this is by any means the key solution
3	IM WORRIED THAT CAMERS WONT PICK UP THEIR RUBISH
0	imexsited because then i sleep on dung beatles
2	imma be the king of the pirates. on the grand line
3	important to get in touch with nature
3	important way to connect with the land and natural environments. more education on leave no trace. banning freedom camping would leve the country to be less accessible for people from all backgrounds. more appreciation respect and education
4	impose fines on peope dig that
3	impossible for The ham of freedom campig is insignificant compared to other environmental harm from agriculture or even highway litter. Banning freedom camping would be blame shifting to poor people and make it even harder for new zealanders to travel our own country
4	In a motorhome we are able to see more of the rural countryside
4	in all my time freedom camping it is the locals Ihave seen who  leave the rubbish.
4	In my opinion banning freedom camping won't improve the current circumstances
4	In my opinion freedom camping is a wonderful way to explore New Zealands beautfiul nature. To ensure rsponsible freedom caming it would be crucial to provide enough facilities to safely get rid of your waste. Right now there are limited opportunidies to do so
1	in my opinion freedom camping is ok if everyone takes care and leave nothing behind but unfortunately not all are thinkig that way. more people less care...because the most think somebody else can do it. also we are not all on same education level how to live sustainability
0	in my opion we should take care of our world its good because wecan have more air and be able to see more animals and people would survive because there will be no fluds and we will have a life ofnature and wewill be free from all thhe horror and pain for animals and we willhave
1	in myperonal opinion.. i lke to camp in my spare time ...but it is worrying how they treat it... but ceebs
3	in roblox horrer games scare me and sometimes its funny scary
1	infrastructure should be built for the Te Araroa walking trail and many more areas need bathroom failities. when you need to go you need to go.
1	inmpacts outweigh benifits and alternitives exsist
3	instead of a ban they should limit the number of people allowed
3	instead of banning. i think the gov could come up w better solutions. such as more bins or fines
3	instead we should educate how to responsiblyfreedom camp andleave no trace
1	interested on how they enforce te policy
3	Introducing certification with a nominal fee and good practice would still allow people access to the environment whilst reducing likelihood of littering and damage. This would also raise more funds for the DOC.
3	intrusion into wild spacs and also effcts of itter and human wse
1	Irresponsible freedom camping leaves a huge mess for local communities and environmental authorities to manage
3	is o ne of AOTEAROA biggest assets. it shoul be controlled better but keep it
0	It  is  bad  because  of  fire  hazard
4	it allows exploration of the beautiful country. done sustainably it is a good thing
3	it allows great freedom for travelers when it is respected
3	it allows people to see more of our beatiful country
0	it brings more harm than good
4	it brings travellers into the country
3	it can be a good thing if done responsibly
4	it can be done in a responsible fashion and this can actually prompt people to take better care for the environment
3	it can be good if people take care of the environment
1	it can be good to allow all people the chance toexperience nature
1	it can impact the world negatively
1	it cause wild fire and leave trash in the wild life
1	It causes a lot of environmental damage.
3	it causes a lot of pollution
3	it coud be damaging for some people thatdont havemany choices
0	it could be cool to go freedom camping
3	it could be done but not sure everyone would treat our nature in the right way
1	It could work as long as there are some campsites.
0	it damages the environment and pollutes water ways and leaves rubbish around including uncontrolled defecation which spreads disease. today is covid left uncontrolled it will be ebola next. filthy and disrespectful. im an eho and frredom camping should be banned.
1	it depends how aware people are of the situation. school has a great role to play.
3	it doesnt address the root cause of the issue which is harmful waste
2	it doesnt statehowmuch freedom campers negatvely effect the enviroment
2	it dont matter as long as you dont poop and pee in the bushes pick one bush to do your buisness its your choice on which bush ok?
0	it favours only a small proportion of the visitors. there must bereasonable alternatives though.
1	it felt so nice and claim
3	it fosters a sense of carefor the environment
1	it gets people in touch wuth nature and more involved
4	It gets people oudoors into nature where they learn its value.  Dont let the few spoil it for the many.
3	it gives you a pace of ind but you should clean up after
4	it gives young people  or any persn that likes tavelling the perfect chance to see the  country and dont spent to much money. i think it needs better ideas how prevent bad things from happening bt surely NOT BANNING it
3	it has enabled meto fall in love ith nz. maybe better controlsaround it if needed. i was kways responsiblea bout it
1	it helps conserve the beautiful enviroment
4	it helps people conect better with nature
3	it i think that it is an ok idea but alot of people enjoy and love the outdoors so this plan may indeed restrict the amount of happines they recive by going outdoors. if this plan goes ahead then i feel alot of people will be mad. even though this plan is to protect the wildlife
1	it is a beginning. many freedom campers leave no trace but so many leave dirt and danger to wildlife.
3	it is a dum aproach. we are nature. some people mess up and we cant stop that.    we should encourange people to spent more time in nature. for many of us it will be a healthy and healing activity.
1	it is a good idea because it ruins our environment
3	IT IS A GOOD WAY TO SEE WHY CONSERVATION IS SO IMPORTANT
4	it is a great reason to come to NZ
3	It is a great way to access natural places and learn and grow appreciaion for nature which can lead to stewadship of land. It needs to be respectfully with leave no trace.
3	it is a nice way to travel and be close to the nature
3	it is a perfect way to discover the country. it should be more regulated
4	it is a problem for backpackers
2	It is a relatively small number of camps
1	it is ac good idea to stop the littering
3	It is always the minority that spoil it for the majority
1	it is an  oppurtunty  to connect with taiao. however it isnot possble if  we do nt take care of our rubbish and damages to pspa
1	it is an important skill . camping isnt in a motorhome or clumped together in a campground
0	it is anyway overcrowded and missused
0	it is bad and it should stop
0	It is bad for the environment and also local business  eg campgrounds
0	it is bad.people do not look after the enviroment that they are in and  pollute our country
4	It is because we make freedom camping that we know well the nature and that we protect it . not everyone is pig !!!
4	it is better to educate people to a better runderstanding but punishing all campers
3	It is better to teach people to take away their rubbish than to forbid everything.
1	it is dangerous because u dontknow if its safe
3	it is finef you take ur rubish with you
4	it is fun and i dont   hav mony
4	it is fun and you can enjoy it with your family .also you can be eductuder about the out doors.
0	it is fun thers games and we can draw and it is fun to watch the things and jokes and hear thngs
0	IT IS FUN TO BE AROUND AND MEET NEW PEOPLE. BE ACTIVE TOO.
3	it is fun to go camping
1	it is good because otherwise the polution will choke animals
1	it is good for  the people
0	it is good for conservation efforts
1	It is good for the environment.People can't really kill more plants.
4	it is good for tourism and creates enjoyment.
1	it is important for generations in the future to save the environment in the present
3	it is important that the people can contact to the nature.
3	it is important that the people can freely access the land. in my country Uk we have very little public access to land and instead it is mostly controlled by private actors. if freedom camping is banned in nz then we should talk about who is allowed to control it instead.
4	it is important toconnect with nature on ourownterms not through the fucking gonvernment !!
3	it is importantto be able tospendtime in theoutdoors. to much restrictions may decrease peoples understanding of our preciousnature. at the same time we all learn totake care of our own garbage.
1	it is importnt to protect the environment
4	it is not fair to stop freedom camping that has been a nz tradition for a long time.
4	it is not guaranteed to work
4	it is not the campers who are the problem  its the teaching of how todo it that islacking. most seious campers love nature and seek to protect it the small minority of random pollutors givenature loving freedom campers a bad name
3	it is not the camping that is the rblem but he behaviour of people. many freedom camp responsibly.. we ned education and ways to deter poor behaviourthat impacts the environment
3	it is not the camping which is the problem but inconsiderate campers
0	it is ok to camp but don't leave your rubbish
3	it is okaslong as itis  not producing litter or desroying the environment
3	it is only a few that abuse the luxury of freedom camping and they would probably do it anyway. most people respect the spaces available
4	it is our rite to be close to nature.if respected  it wontbe damaging. focus on greater enviromental problems
4	it is peoples resonsibility to care for  the environment
1	it is positive change firthe environment
0	IT IS REALLY FUN & I LOVE IT
0	it is right people shoudnt be able tofreedm camp
3	it is ruined by the minority
4	it is sad for people who respect the nature and just want to enjoy it for free
3	it is sad that we lose our own freedom due to our own behaviour.
3	It is sad to ban wild camping... that people are not educated enough to take care f their environments. hikers such as myself know better and i feel that those people punish us by leaving their rubbish behind
3	it is sad to think the people who lovenature cannot take care of it
1	It is sad we cannot be trusted to freedom camp but I am hopeful it can be regulated whilst still affordable. And that this will spread a message about caring for papatuanuku.
4	It is so disappointing that those who want to exercise their freedom to camp can't care enough about their surrounds. Their behavior means legislature that prevents good people from enjoying what should be a right.
3	it is so great to experience nature so it should stay allowed
4	it is so stupid to take away people's rights
3	it is sometimes fun and you have lessscreentime
3	it is such a good thing to visit the country and to be surronded by nature. easy to anyone.it's very sad that because of some people (again) we'll all loose this privilege.and i am sorry to say that i feel the traveller is not the only one: moto&4x4 on the beach.spraying.plastic
4	it is the best way to enjoy nature. but of course leave notrace
4	It is the best way to explore the nature as long as everybody leaves the places cleaner than before.
0	it is the rightthing to do
4	it is the wrong approach to ban it. what about all the people who do it responsibly? and all the nz locals who explore this way?
0	it is very cool. i learn new things.
3	it is very nice to have nights into the nature.  reduce problem for the environment thanks to campers education
4	it isnot that hard toput you rubishaway and use public toilets or travltoilet
3	it leavs a mess  that kill our native wildlife
3	it lets me see less nature
1	it may negatively affect tourisn but in the end our natural environment is ar more important.
1	IT MORE INPORTANT TO PROTECT THEN INVIROMENT
3	It negatively affects responsible campers. Freedom camping is a great way to travel and I will not mind donating to causes for outreach and cleanups.
3	it prevents a closeness to nature if banned. holiday parks are useful but are a more artifical experience of nature
3	It ruins the "rugged and untouched" reputation.
3	it ruins the environment and can endanger native anmals
4	it s said we have to think about banning freedom cmping because of iresponsible campers that leave rubbish and destroy the nature they campin. IT SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE. Human and nature should live clos together in a symbiose and humans should not be the parasite.
4	it seems arbitrary to only limit the things poor people mightdorather than so manycapitalist ventures thatdoso much more harm. no coincidence here.
4	it shold stay with more options for people campers to make good choices
3	it shoud be somehow controlled to protect the enviroment.  bigger fines for those who destroy or leave behind a mess. our world is beautiful we should all be able to enjoy.
3	It shoudnt be banned. But people leaving behind rubbish and caught should be fined.
3	it should always be free to enjoy. fines should be imposed instaed
3	it should be a right  . big corporate makes it too pricey otherwise. let everyone see this great country not just the rich
4	it should be allowed and controlled
3	it should be allowed but monitored when possible and offenders who leave rubbish should be unished
3	it should be allowed but more rul esand regulations in place. Designated areas in place with bins etc.
1	it should be allowed but numbers limited in some way.  The people of NZ should be allowed to freedom camp but not tourists just trying to save money.
3	IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED BUT PEOPLE THAT LEAVE THEIR TRACE SHOULD BE HEAVILY FINED.
1	it should be allowed but regulated
4	it should be allowed it is fun
3	it should be allowed so people can experience the beauty of NZ
4	it should be allowed. i freedom camp respectfully. we arent al bad people
4	it should be allowed. only scumbags dont take their rubbish
4	it should be alowed as long as the area is left in the same conditon. huge fines if not
3	it should be available for reasponsible people.
1	it should be banned as people especially tourists leave litter and stuff that harms the enviroment if you want to camp go to a camping ground
1	it should be banned because its there home not ours and we shouldt mess withit. they make our world feel alive so lets keep itthatway
0	it should be bannedso it will reduse waste.
3	it should be controlled but not banned. There should be toilets and rubbish collection all the time to avoid pollution
4	it should be encouraged but consequences made clear for those who disrespect the land
2	it should be legal for new zealanders
4	it should be managed better. not banned
3	it should be managed but supported
1	it should be managed. we want to encourage people to enjoy visiting aotearoa but be respectful
1	it should be more rules and only possible when a urgend manner
3	it should be regulated but not banned
1	it should be regulated with clear expectations so we can have both
1	it should be to protect the environnemnt from stupidity
1	it should have limited place for camping.but restrict people to camp incetain area.
1	it should hopefully cut down on waste in the enviroment
3	it should just be better regulated
1	it should not be banned but regulated properly to protect our wildlife
3	it should not be banned how ever people need to be educared in remving there rubbish to appropriate areas. leave only foot prints
4	it should still be available to nzers to enjo our beautiful country
0	it shouldbe banned t keep our pristine enviromnts safe
4	it shouldbe cntrolled better bylazy well aid councleworkers
3	it shouldbe supervised but not banned. it would be verysad for campers who care about the environment to lose this amazing right
3	it shouldnt be banned bcase is rad
4	it shouldnt be banned be cause it would be judging people
3	it shouldnt be banned but closely monitored so that the environment is still protected
4	it shouldnt matter unless they cause harm to the environment
1	it shows care and respect for papatuanuku
1	It shows that we are mindful of and care for our environment
4	it shuld be enjiyed abd the ines who trash it shiuldnt ruin it fir everyone elce
4	it shuld bemore controlled but nt banned
1	it shws people aretaking the problem seriuosly
4	it souldbe allowed but with stricter fines for misbehaviour
1	it soundsl ike a good idea but i wonder how long it will take for people to stop
0	it sucks like who evenenoys it
4	it takes advantage unfairly of nz
3	it takes away the feeling of beeing free as a bakpacker country its one of the most amazing thing NZ can offer
1	it will be betterfor the enviroment
0	it will be great to have a dedicated space for camping to regulate the spread of human waste and rubbish
3	it will be much harder for a lot of people to discover and experience all of Aotearoa.
3	it will exclude responsible campers who wish to enjoythe natural environment
0	it will get better over the years:)
0	It will have  less of an impact on our environment.
1	it will help a littlt but here are bigger fish to fry
0	it will help the anials sruvivle and keep them safe from poching
1	it will help the invirement a lot
1	it will help to protect nature
3	it will impair perception of nature
0	it will protect more native areas
1	It will reduce the waste left behind and also keep our forests clean.
1	it will save the environment and preven people from  trowing rubish to the wilderness
3	IT WILLHARM NATIVE WILDLIFE.IT IS  A BIG OPPERATIONTO CLEAN IT ALL UP SO IF WE NEVER DOIT IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER
2	it wont make a diffrence bro
1	it works if other free options are offered and unfortunately there are not enough for (Å«nrÄsppectful) people to do the effort
3	it worries me my kids wont enjoy  the new zealand outdoors like i did as it will become a white luxury and no longer be free
4	it would be a shame. let pepole discover the outdoors but they ned to have repesct for it beauty.
0	it would be better for the environment
0	It would be good because alot of campers are careless about preserving nature.
3	It would be much better if environmental awareness grew and every camper simply took and recycled their rubbish.
3	it would be sad for people to lose this connection to nature. Police it better. Teach 'leave no trace' in schools.
1	it would be so amazing ifwe could protect this abilty for futre generations. this might involve education and facilities
3	it would only get worse. the government should provide more public facilities for freedom camper
1	ithink it shouldnt be banned but there should be alot more restrctions
0	ithink that ther are too many people do not care or think it does not matter and woul not be willing to correct their ways
2	ithink thes seig mob is better than the blcks but everyone hasan opion
1	ithink this idea will establish more ecosystems for our enviroment which allows animals toseek more places forshelter food and more
1	itis very damaging to the envionmrnt
3	its a fantastic way of engaging with natral nz if respected
1	its a geat opportunity for everyone on a budgetto travel
4	its a ggod way to explore the country
3	its a goddamn hobbyppl. ido think waste should beredued tho. maybe weighing stations?
1	its a good dea but people shuld be able to camp in a resposible way
1	its a good idea to preserve nature
1	its a great thung but we need more public facilities to support people todo it well and without impacting nature
4	its a great way to connect with nature
3	its a great way to discoer a country
4	its a great way to encourage youngsters from overseas to workand give into the economy. it could be controlled better and stricter rules inforced for clearig up
4	its a great way to see nz
4	Its a great way to seethe beautiful country on a budget. to ban it would be gentrifying.
3	its a great way to seethe country for people with less money when done responsibly
3	it's a matter of educating people on how they benefit from a clean environment which is key to tourism
4	its a matter of freedom. whilst responsibility should be enouraged and enforced; to outright ban it would be tyranical and prevent the growth for love of the environment. Education is key.
3	its a nice way for people to responsibly enjoy nature
3	its a part of the culture and whats point in protecting all the beautiful land onlyto restrict campers to commercial sites.  why restrict the peoplewho appreciate the land the most
3	its a reactive reaction too a small group
1	It's a shame- but sacrificing an activity a small number of people enjoy is worth it for the greater good. we make similair sacrifices all the tine.
4	its a shame when people leave rubbish behind. they ruin the experience and the opportunity of the next person. however  thats no reason to ban it. people who do not comply with the rules should be bannend.
1	its a smart idea because lots of people dont actualy carewhat impact their actionshave on the enviroment. this should help to increse the population of naitive wild life.
1	its a step in the right direction
0	its a very whiteperson with dreads thing to do
4	its a way fr peopleto discinnect from reality
3	its a way to conectwith nature
3	its a worry asitwillimpactonthe restfthe beautiful birds animals fishland whchis already havinga prblem surviving
3	its about education to do it with minimal impact. is it better to have more camervans on road?
3	its about eduction not simply banning something
3	it's alarming to learn that camping canbe hazardousforthe biodiversity while it should have a smaller impact than living in houses which consune a lot more energy/ petrol and water to buil and the to live
4	it's an attack on personal freedom
3	its apart of nz identity but probs will help the environment
4	its bad  because then  kids  dont  learn  about cmping.
1	its bad because littwering and fires
3	its cool to camp in random places abd descvernew things
1	Its disgsting and bad for r country
1	Its easier for us to giveup the free luxury of camping without paying to ebsure our future can enjoy the luxury of life
4	Its easy to look at a freedom campsite and complain about waste. But most campsites are an awful lot cleaner than the side of any highway or city street. A lot of campers clean beaches and areas where city folk gather and mess in their weekends.
3	its evryones planet  but people need to leave it as they found it
3	its fantastic to trvel your beautiful country and stayon wonderful places for free. makebetter easier ways to trow away garbich. we wanna help to keep it clean but at some places its difficult
3	its fine to camp outside its no hurting anyone
4	its foolish to thing this is the only time toose areas are impacted. seems like people in cities who know little about living in a way that is healthy and free painfully limiting us as we try to live our lives if you
4	its fun and i dont leave behinde rubbish
0	its good for all native things
3	its good for people to appreciate nature
4	its good to ge out of the country
4	its great for people to be in nature. god made our world and it is a blessing to enjoy it
0	ITS GREAT GET OUT THE OUTSIDERS
3	its great people can still go out and experience nature
3	its how i connect to nature
1	It's important that our environment gets taken care of so I hopethat the ban makes a difference
4	its important that people easy can take part of the nature and therefor be willing to protect it
3	its important to allow all types of tourists access to nz. it just needs to be reulated.
1	its important to protect your wildlife. and unfortunate that people leve waste when camping in thewild.
1	It's more important to protect nature than allow people the freedom to wildcamp.
4	its nice to travel the country like that
4	its not a problem of freedom caming. instead a problem ofthose peoplewho dumb rubbish.
1	its not necessary to have free camping to enjoy this country
1	its not that good to camp anywhere but its ok to camp at campsites
2	its not that much to care about like i dont care because i dont camp so pople who do camp abd do it for fun would care and be worried. but yeah. so i recommend not taking it away becuase people who camp ar gonna be mad
3	its not theright solutionto the problem
3	its nz biggest industy. they should make strict laws and punishments if people leave rubbish behind
2	its okayifyucleanup afteryourelf and dobt lace mark
3	its okif theres no mess left
3	its one of things Nz has to offer. maybe regulting and inforcing new rules to control the issues instead of stopping it.
3	Its only a select few ruining for others
4	its only the idiots that leave rubbish
1	its our backyard we have to live  here i dont want to stand in someone elss shit because theyre too lazy to find a place to flush away their exrement or puttheyre rubbishin a bin
4	its our country that we pay taxes and have every right to the land
4	its really good to get out doors and restrecting people to not camp out in a feild or the woodsis really bad because people love doing it. its like taking away peoples fav passion.
4	its sad for the people who are responsible
3	its sad people cannot respect the space to the extent that such a ban would be needed
3	Its sad that people dont look after the environment they are in . i love freedom camping and wish my children could have the same chance to explore nz and feel connected to the land.
3	its sad wish we could learn and teach others to respect land. important for connecting with nature
3	its so sad how its killing and can i get uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
0	its stupid to leave your rubbish behind
3	its such a good opportunity for people with a much lower budget to explore the country. Education and more rubbish bins
3	Its the main reason tourists come to NZ. There would be way less tourism and less seasonal workers
0	its the only way of reducing direct negative impact on nature
3	its the wrong question... our citys show how people that wouldnt even regard to tent treat nature *trash everywhere* ... its not about camping in the nature ... its about changing the society   so that everyone tries to protect enviroment
1	its too difficult to control freedom camping. especially inrestrictedareas with wildlife
1	its too much pressure on the enviroment
4	its very bad for the enviroment because if u go camping out  in the woods and u make a fire u coud posibly cause a fire and could die fom all this
3	itsa good way toexplore yur own backyard
4	itshould not be because there is litte harmto come from it soyou guys can ban it to say its better for the enviroment but it is just to make the goverment lookbetter
3	ITSimportant that people strengthen their bndwit nature. why cnserve if not to serve.

2	just need to enforce better caming and environmental legislature/etiquitte
4	just not somethg ineed ti worry aboutin he berfuture
3	just put rulesin place. it is better to educate than take away priviledges like this. people especially children need opprtunities to learn how to enjoy nature while respectig it.
2	just so lonely that they dont care any more
4	just take your rubbish with you and camp responsibly

3	keep encouraging people to beresponsible and not leave rubbish
3	kiwis dont usually poop in their own backyard. the do care about our environment. usually the ones that disrespect our environment are visitors to our country. so why should new zealanders be punished for not being able to freedom camp they are not usually yhe offenders.
2	kuki airang to the world 682
3	l think we  must keep camping because it makes people feel free and welcome to nature.
4	lack of respect for natureby all not just freedom camping is the real issue freedom camping is nomore than a tiny scapegoat fora much bigger issue lifestyle this is about generating revenue from nature
0	land is more important than people
3	lbeing able to go out and be a part of nature is the reson i have changed my habbits to better protect. there should b rules and laws around keeping freedom camping a clean and tidy hobby but there should not be an outright ban. through these sorts of activities peoplecan enjoytr
1	leave a mess.Should be paying for accommodation.
1	leave itas you find it wouldyou shit in your own nest
3	Leave no trace initiatives and other positive but enforced rules are the lighter choice. bans dont solve problems they push them into hiding.
4	leave the place how you found it
4	Leave things alone!  Stop interfering with peoples lives.
4	leaving behind trash is shit.campig withoutleaving a trace is ok and i love it.
4	leaving plastic is bad for the earth.
3	leaving rubbish . do not respect our environment
4	leaving the areaas you find itbis acceptable and a greatway tosee the coubtry and different areas vakues
1	lenvironment est incroyable et il faut quon prend soin
4	less accessible for those who cant afford expensive holidays
0	less s... lefton the side of the road
0	let naturetake its own course against  the human race as  nature will  always beat us
4	let people camp freely. provide more bins
4	let tem cp but t mae sure threyclean up after themselfs
4	let the camp bt to follow certain rules
4	let them explore this beatiful country xx
1	Let us preserve what is left
1	leve nothing but a foot print. thats hiwit shoukd b
3	like most things freedom camping is only bad when done irresponsibly
0	limit damage to our envronment and keep our public lands clean for future generations
1	LITtering is VERY bad for the enviroment
4	loaded statement because nore people respect the environment
2	LOL IDC AND DID NOT ASK L
4	long  distance hiking is my passion. camping is an important  aspect of that. as  trampers we  need have good leave no trace practices. i think there  is a lack   of education. i would rather see  more outreach and education rather than a ban.
0	looking after the enviroment is paramount
3	loses the pleasure of LIVINg inAOTEAROa it should be more controlled but not bnned
3	loss of tourism. dip in economy
3	lots of animals can get hurt thats why im worried
0	lots of beautiful free appointed spots so no need to bother nature
3	Lots of people disagree because they  want
1	lots oftrash is left behind while camping and that could be really harmful to native creatures.
4	love and appreciation of the wilds can only be achieved by being in it. Rather than banning it there should be far better education made available. Maybe people should be able to attend courses on how to behave in the wilds. They could the apply for a license to freedom camp!
3	love camping only if people can respect our land as well
4	low income tourists are not theproblem. stop providing infastructure for only self contained. stop blaming backpackers for your long term policy failures
2	low low low ur boat down the street
3	lts beacause we l mean some of us love camping but it ruined the enviroment so we have two choises
4	lucan is a not good frend
3	Makes camping a rich persons activity
1	makes it easier for nature to strive
3	makes it harder for young people to explore nature
0	makes theworld a livable place for our future generaton
3	makesurepeople  can  throw away their rubbish
4	many motorhomers with self contained vehicles use freedom camping sites very responsibly and protect this priviledge passionately. Problems are caused by a lack of respect for the environment and these people have to be educated.
2	Many other countries only allow designated campsites for the same purpose.
3	many peope like me are absolutly thankful for freedom camping und dont leave any rubbish etc. thanks for the free camping option
1	Many people are not aware of the damage they may cause.
3	Many people come to NZ to experience the stunning nature here. Camping responsibly in the middle of this nature you feel so in awe that you want to protect it with all you can contribute. Camping on campgrounds just doesnt give you that feeling of connection to nature.
4	many people respect the nature but then it is forbitten for everyone.
3	Maori people are bought up on the land
4	maoris should be banned. they are extremely harmful to the environment
4	MAYBE a bit too far? But there should be stricter rules in place.
1	maybe freedom camping sitesneed more rubbish collection
3	Maybe in the future some native animals will be able to recoverthis way.
1	maybe it would stop fore.st fires and there would be less rubbish.
1	maybe not ban but regulate and create awareness
1	maybe we can not ban freedom camping but have certian restrictions around whatyou can brig and do there as well as fine peopleif they are found littering
4	me   and my family go freedom camping over the holiays for fun
1	Me mahi tahi me ngÄ uri whakaheke aua whenua rÄ kia kite ai i ngÄ hua
3	me noho koutou i nga papa  tika.  Whakautua te moni.
3	mean nzers get limited as well
1	men should share their feelings more
3	mi granyhas go to argentina argentina is were i live
4	minority should notdictate and ruin a beautiful expierincesch as caming. enforce better bins and cleaning areas.
4	More education around the impact of waste.
3	More education is needed. Not banning. Banning it will only cause more trouble.  Educate the tourists as they pick up their vehicles. Help them to help us.
4	more facilities should be available. also many freedoms are self contained. you would need to ban picnicing
2	more important things to worry abot
1	more people need to be aware of ensuring that they remove all their waste
3	more people need to connect and experience the beauty of nature. teach them to do it with respect
4	more provision for freedom camping would allow for better rubbish and wastedisposal
3	more restriction could help without fully taking camping away
3	morepublic toilets on freedom campingsites and higher fines for littering
4	most campers are there to enjoy and protect the envionment. better signage for distance to toilets could help.
3	most campers care forthe nature they live in. if there are spots whereit isnotallowed it is okay but why bann it compleately?
4	most do the right thing. Prohibition will only mean the people that look after such places will stop going.
4	most free campers dispos of waste responsibly. dnt punsh all for tr slackness of some
4	Most freedom campers are responsible.  We need better monitoring and systems to ensure compliance for the few that spoil it. Campgrounds are largely unaffordable and travelling and enjoying our country will become for the wealthy if freedom camping is banned.
4	Most freedom campers do not have a negative impact. I not only never leave a trace but also act as kaitiaki and collect any rubbish i see. Freedom camping is a gift Aoteroa has to offer the people and encouraging people to love the land
4	most freedom campers I know love and respect the environment . That is why they travel and camp in nature.
4	most freedon campers are responsible and wish to commune witht the environment. tgier children willgrow up knowing a better world and understanding.
1	most nature lovers will leave campsites clean but we do affect nature unfortunately
3	most of the freedom campers are cleaning up afte themselves and take their trash with them. just because a few wont behave everyone is in a bad light
3	MOST PEOPLE ARECONSIDERATE AND THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE PENALIZED
4	most people do care about nature and youcan tell people how to care for the enviroment.
4	most people take care of the invierment why should the majoridy go down for something the a small group of careless litterers do?
1	Most people would litter in theenviroments
1	most respect the environment . abusers should forefit their transport.how you policethis im not sure
3	must be conserved but with big fines for non respetful people
4	My coat was stolen at last week's inerfet banquet so I helped myself to some few-the-better umbarellas

2	naruto has to much filler episodes
1	native animals and flora will increase in population providing more nutrition to local communities and ecosystems
0	native birds will  start tocome back to the bush
1	natural pollution from animals themselves like droppings or just non decomposed remains are enough or maybe too much for the little critters or the biggest beasts of the forest to handle. so even if you want to be outside for thrills atleast pick up your own waste and shit
4	nature and the outdoors should be free for everyone to enjoy; responsibly.
3	nature has to be protected at all costs
4	nature is for everyone. tech the right behaviour
3	nature is very  important for the soule and we should feel how is it beeing outside but to leave it clean and to punish the ones who do it.
4	nature isfor  all to enjoy responsibally
4	nature should be accessable to everyone
3	nature should be accessible fore everyone
4	nature should be enjoy to anyone
4	nature should be enjoyed by anyone. if people tke care of nature. it should not be  problem
4	nature should be for every budget but conditions are ok.
4	nature should be free for everyone. why not teach people how to camp without harming the nature?
3	nature us important and humans long term impact is not looking at this.
3	need more evidence that freedom camping is very harmful before we ban it
1	need topro tectand preseve some areas
2	never heard of it. do not care.
3	New Zealand doesnt have much to offer. The accessability freedom camping offers is a big tourist drawcard so the ecoomy would suffer without it
1	new zealand is doing better than most countries at protecting native biodiversity - banning freedom camping would only help this. save our planet!
4	new zealand portrays itself as a country of free travel but it is getting more expensive and less enjoyable to travel here. don't rent out campervans if there is nowhere to camp in nature. put bins ; toilets and facilities andpeople will use them.
3	New Zealand should be shared with its people. Better education. signage. and places dedicated to free camp will help protect the environment
3	new zealanders should be able to travel around their own country as the majority are resonsible freedom campers and look afterthe enviroment
4	Nnot everyone leaves their waste in nature. Most campers behave responsible.
2	no cause its fun ad we should be able todo what we want
1	no freedom camping is better for the enviroment
0	no matter how much care there will always be some waste left behind. so banning camping is good.
0	no more trash being deposited into our environment
4	no one cares especially our government departments where it should all startabd they own allour national parks
0	no one wins from freedom camping. the environment people travelled to see is slowly denegrated and there is little contribution to the economy to protect the environment or help with infrastructure
1	no resources go to supporting the environment
4	No! Stop rising out of the floor! I don't wanna go to the breakfast buffet with you!
2	normal camping is expensive for backpackerstravelling on a budget
3	not a majr contribter to pollution
3	not all cmpers adversley affect the environment
3	not all freedom campers are there to negatively impact the enironment
1	Not all humans are responsible enough to be left freely with nature It is th greater good to protect what is left
3	Not allpeople will fnd this as a gd solution and will try to break the set rules
3	not enough affordable camping areas. also freedom camping allows ppl to connect to nature. do nt ban but rather teach a better mentality.
4	not enough being done by policy level gvmt
4	not everone can afford to stay in park or hotels
3	Not everybodyis disrespectful. Don't let the few ruin the beautiful freedom caming spots and chance to enjoy nature in our beautiful country up close for everybody else!
1	not everyone appreciatesnature and ow to respect it
4	not everyone can afford the luxury of owning a campervan or caravan. only way to get into nature without all the frills!!!

1	not everyone is littering. few bad apples spoil the bunch
4	not everyone leave behind rubbish some are respectul

2	not goig o mak thedifference we need
1	not good for environment or economy
3	not good i like to camping a lot
3	not monitored well enough.  Puts too much pressure on public facilities
4	notanybody  leaves rubbish just need to educate people
3	NZ is an amazing country with unbelievable nature. Responsible camping is a great way to experience it and learn more. If people cant respect this it shouldnt be free
4	nz is an expensive country to visit this reduces the number of backpackers who can bring value with correct education gentrification of tourisms is poor idea. correct management of freedom caming can further educate everyone
3	NZ needs the extra revenue the freedom campers bring.
3	nz outdoors must remain economically viable to ALL kiwi
3	NZ should be available to everyone. There should be more toilets and waste management for freedom camping sites.
3	nzs enviroment should be accessible to all people regardless of income. what we need are better facilities and education for those wanting to experience nz this way
4	often freedom campers use the toilets and bins provided anyway. Its a cheap way of exploring our county. We can still have freedom campers AND protect the environment. Its about education
4	one persons actions shouldnt affext the masses
3	only a few leave rubbish not the majority
3	Only a few leave their waste and this ruins it for the rest. Many campers care about nature and their impact on the environment. Its important to be free & learn to respect our natural world. More people need to be properly educated  to share the beautiful place in which we live.
4	Only a very small % campers not doing the right thing, why should very small minority ruin it for the rest of us. We spend $ in communities as we travel. Public toilets used where avail and carry a camping toilet to do the right thing  but can't be certified. Dont kill camping!
1	Only environmental concious people should be free camping
0	only kiwis should have the right to camp where they like.  freedom campers from over seas are bad news for nz . they have made communitys mad and  made it hard for the rest of us. they dont spend money to be here.
2	only people who dont fly in planes get a vote
3	only whhen you leave it clean. respect nature.
3	onlya few freedom campers leave rubbish behind

2	OOPS WE ARE SO SORRY BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I DONT CAREYOU ERROR WAS LOGGED ON ID 64728ebdsg464378udplseat7472 HAHA LOL
1	osi think that the question is to simplistic. as long as people who are going out camping in nz take care abd watch what they are doing in the environmet then it should be ok. but there are always going to be people who don't give a damn abot our environment: so yeahh
4	others ruin freedom camping for people who are good custodians of the land
0	otherwise all these animal will become extinct
4	ots of peopledo therightthing andthey shouldntbepunished
1	Our Contry is too important not to !
0	our economy needs tourists to pay their way
1	our entertainment is nt as important as protecting the environment.

1	our environment is slowly getting destroyed
1	Our flora and fauna will certainly benefit from this venture. The truth is people are inherently selfish causing polluted ecosystens around the world. This is demonstrated all the time with free camping.
3	our freedoms to travel  and explore will be taken away.
1	our inviroment is special and its going to out live us so we need to protect it even is that means youll miss like a week off fun
1	our needs and wants are not themost important. leave no trace is vital to teach and practice but is often neglected so therefore caming should happen in designated areas.
4	our origins are wild.  to take the wild from humans is to encourage separation from nature. experiencing nature in the raw form is one of the best ways to really understand and develop love for it
0	our unqiuie nature is more important than humans access tofreedom camping
4	PEOLPLE SHOULD CLEAN UP AFTER THEMSELVES. butit shouldnt be banned completely
0	peope suck and if they dont treat places nicely they shouldnt be allowed to go!!!!
3	Peopele should be educated on the LNT principles and how to care for the whenua. Without the knowledge and a straight ban people will procede to camp and distroy. Taking away the option doesnt fix the problem.

1	people get more aware and clean after themselves
3	People have a right to enjoy nature. Regulate it.
3	people have to learn how to keep the environment clean.they should be educated and there should be better cotrolled with rangers or something similiar to keep an eye on the people who just dont care about the nature. do fines baedon income. then itll hurt

3	people just need to be respectful of the land

3	people should still camp because it is lots of fun and exiting and you learn new things and make new friends while having an adventure.
4	People should stop littering and clean up afterr themselves to minimise the impact on the environment
3	people should take better care of the environment and show respect
4	people should take care of the enviroment no matter what place they are in
4	people should take care of their own rubbish
4	People should take more care and should leave no trace but more could be done to help people make better decisions  about their rubbish abd excrement.  Banning freedom camping is NOT the answer.  Resources and amenities are.  Long drops and rubbish   collectio would help.
4	people should take their waste with them. Approriate toilet should be dug.
3	People shouldfeel responsible for the environment and i think hat most people that do freedom campingt are because they are thankful for it
1	people shouldnt have free range over the and beacuse they have proven that they destroy it. It would be better frr the envirinment if you put out tras for pests and keep huans away
4	people shouldnt leave their stuff behind. That would be so much better
2	people shuld be alllowd to camp
3	people shuld be educated on theimportance of cleaning up.free camping is a greatopportuniyu

3	people thoroghly enjoy being at one with nature
4	people want to camp responsibly. provide easy to acces bins and people will use them or should be finedheavily
2	people wh freedn camp generally care about th envrmnet
0	people whether informed ornot are not respectful of the environment especially tourists and this is a secure way to protectour environment. people shoud use camping or doc sites wuth fcilities intead
1	People whether they are local or tourists need to be more informed and educated about where our world is heading for example; polution_fumes by cars and machines also fires_fuels and gases.  Until then Freedom Camping needs to be more regulated and limited.
3	people who are responsible should be allowed
3	people who camp responsibly will not hurt the environment too much.
4	people who know nature know whyto prote
0	people who lack consideration for this bountiful environment should not have the right to camp in it
3	people who leave the rubbish in nature are stupid.  But I dont think that is a problem of freedom camps but uneducated and selfish people.
3	people will continue to camp anyway and it is better to provide infrastructure to minimise damage and promote interest
3	people will continue to do so ad try to be sneaky and makeit worse
3	people will continue to ignore the rules
3	people will do it anyway like the covidprtests.better to suport with infrastructure and limit the areas where its allowed
3	people will ignore what you say and do it anyway they really dont care.                                            and that sucks because there are some people who wouldent give it up if there home was at stake
0	people will not be allowed to do it and destroy the world
4	people will not get to experience nature properley
1	PEOPLE WILL STILL FREEDOM CAMP ON A SMALLER SCALE
3	people will stop conecting with nature. we are part of the enviroment. we need to be in not out. inplement fees if need be
3	people willcamp annyway so lets putthem inspecific spots. where we can easily controll if they do stupid things and destroy the enviornment
3	People won't be abke to explore and expeience nature as easily.
4	people wont come to nz anymore.
4	people wont stop.  just add bathrooms and regulate canping.
4	people would take care if bins  and toilets were provided
0	peoplejust live thereand put all ofthe stuff in the bush
0	peopleshould be more responsible for their waste
3	peopleshould be mre careful. there should be rules agaibst littering in wild places ad lots of regulations regarding camping in nature preserves
4	peoplewho freedom camp are usually the ones concerned about the biodiversity and the protection of the wilderness and mostly engaged n climate change. also it is a good way to become aware of our environment
4	phht. everyone will get sick if you do that.
1	please make available basic facilities for campers such as toilets and rubbish bins. responsibilities lie with everyone. allowing all people to enjoy the outdoors.
3	po xchri poo elliot poo willem poo felix NOT POO ANELA HAHAHAHAA

4	ppl just need to take their rubbish with them
1	preservation of the enviorment should be the priority
3	prevents a popular for kiwis and travellers to see more inimate parts of new zealand. educate people more about how to be n a delicate envionmnet without damaging it.
4	Prohibition takes away valuable ressources that could be used toprotect the environment  rather than infringe on people enjoying nature.
0	protect environment is more important than the joy offreedom caming
1	protect environment rubbish in rightplace . money from ccomodation to environment. waste properlydealt with
3	protect nature FOR people not  from people
3	protecting nature needs to be the highest priority but i am not sure rules that restrict access to nature are necessarily the way to go
1	protecting the area is more inportant than taking a holiday
1	PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT
0	protection of native fauna. im a tramper
1	Protection of native species is very important
0	protection of ourplanet is vastly more important than cheap holidays for the most detructive species on the planet
0	protects environment and directs tourism into places with adequate infrastructure
4	Provide infastructure so rubbish and human waste can be disposed of correctly
3	provide safe spots to do so.sites
1	provided spaces are affordable and have services that protect our environment better. diffucult to enforce though
1	ptotect the fragile environment and reduce human pollution
4	Punish the abuser not those who are considerate of the environment. Dont put all freedom campers in the same basket.
3	put controls around it. shouldnt be outright banned
0	qqqqwaaaaaaaaaassssssssdddddXXCqwwwe this will help preserve our land
1	rather than a full ban i think some sort of liscence should be distribted to responsble campers allowing them to camp freely
4	Rather than ban it all together perhaps promote more awareness to the campers about their impact on the beauty of this land.  Freedom camping is wonderful!
1	rather than outright ban we should look to enforce clear rules to allow enjoyment of nature for those who seek it whilst providing maximum enviromental protection.
4	reality is sad but there will always be disrespectful people. banning freedom camping will punish all the respectful campers. hopefully there are heaps of nice places thanks to the doc
1	really dont lÄ«kÄ thÄ wÄstÄ lÄft behind
3	reason young people come to nz
4	reasonable naturelovers shouldnt sufferbecauseif some disrespecful wankers. freedon camping only for kiwis
3	Removing people from nature seems like a poor solution. Education on how to responsibly enjoy would be better.
3	resonsible camping should not harm the environment. people should be encuraged to camp without leaving rubbsh rather than ban camping.
3	RESPECT THE COUNTRY THE PEOPLE AND EACH OTHER
3	responiblepeople should beable to enjoy freedom camping.provided they adhere to strick guidelines around caring for our natural environment.
3	responsible campers shouldnt be a problem.
3	responsible camping puts people in touch with nature. this hopefully helps individuals to value it more.
4	responsible freedom camping does not disturb nature.
3	Responsible freedom camping doesnt harm the environmentandkeeps us closer to nature
3	RESPONSIBLE freedom camping should be allowed in all countries.
1	restrict the area of camping but not banning it
4	Restricting access to the outdoors leads to a more isolated community.
4	restrictions should be in place to protect the enviroment
4	Reuben Godfrey hangs out at public playgrobds too much
3	reventing people from accessibg their nature spaces will create apath for is well being. howcan people know or value what they dont experience?
3	risk of fire and litter and scaring natrual wildlife
4	rubbish and hunan wasre is the issue. not campibg itseldf
3	rubbish is often left by freedomcampers which is disresoectful and affects how we can all experience our beautiful country.
3	rules and regulations should be enfrced to mantain better care of the environmnt without compromising on tourism
3	sad but understandable. not everyone makes a mess of natural environments so it sucks to ban freedom camping just because of the idiots that do.
4	sad thatpeople cant take theirstuff with them
0	Sadly we are at the point that there are too many freedom campers.. Even if most of them are tidy. i'm in favour of retaining the ecology of thenatural environment. Pollution from campers is pretty bad currently- in some of themost scenic spots in NZ.
0	save our environment. protect for future generations
1	save those animals no more frredomn camnpoingg
1	Saving our enviourment will make the planet last longer. We only have one earth

3	school people how to respect nature from a young age.
4	Seems strange to demonize people being in nature when the accumulated negative impact of any city or our daily lives is orders of magnitude greater.
1	self contained freedom caming shoukd be allowed in designated areas but shoud be outlawed in most reservation areas

4	skibddy bab bab bab bab yes yes yes yes
4	sleeping in nature is vital.  there is a huge lack of facilities outside towns in nz especially bins . its hard to imagine banning camping would have more effect than say banning plstic  .
1	smore information is needed for those going to go freedom camping or maybe have specific grounds for those travelling back country to place rubbish but human waste is hard to remove in rural areas
0	so  we can protect animals and nature
1	so are fish wont be exsticket and the res of are birds a safe

1	sopeoplewill learn to brig bck their rubbish
3	sorry about my son's terrible typing
4	Staying overnight in nature should be accessible to all. Motels etc are absurdly expensive in NZ. Don't ban - Regulate  and provide facilities instead so travel accomodation isn't just for the wealthy.
4	stop elling us what to do
3	stop tourist indusrty  whÄ«ch Ä«n tÅ«rn IS NOT GOOD FORECONOMY there needs to be a goodmix not everone can affird campigjust enforce the fines for bad apples
2	strangest thing is i didnt ask
3	Stricked rules and sympathy for our beautiful nature is needed. In that way we can live peacefully together. Peoplefinally have to understand that nature is the most preachuse thing inthe world which also has the potential to make us very happy. Theirfore we have to respect it.
3	Stricter litter and waste laws and punishment not outright banning freedom camping :)
1	stricter rules should apply and there should be certain areas people can camp
3	take a poop in a toilet..... not our bush
3	take advantage of our beautiful land
4	Takes away freedom caming to people thatlook after our country
4	takes away some of the onl freedom we have left

4	teaching people to value and be custodians of their environment wuld be more effective
4	tents only in the bushonly   less impact
3	tepsHEAVY RESTICTIONS AND GUIDLINES SHOULD BE ENFORCED .EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SHARED WITH ALL CITIZEN.   THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY you can learn from other countries missteps.

1	that it is super imortant to protect and restore wilderness.. and that shuld tke priority over scenic camping trips
4	That it provides a huge advantage for campers like me to be able to freedom camp. We should rather increase controls. Only a minority leaves waste behind. If we have freedomcamp areas which are often looked after and regulated we can avoid that the nature suffers.
2	that it should be allowed but poor treatment of the environment should be strongly fined

0	that some of the endangered  animals will be safer that way.
4	that spongebob and i should get a say in this
3	that the forest  deserves to live and its not fair to chop it down!!!!!!!!
4	that the land should be available for camping in designates areas and basic facilities...water a long drop provided.tourists bring money and many of them create climate issues...perhaps wecould also ban private jets and helicopter rides which also negatively impact the envt
1	that the leave rubbish .And they are not tangata whenua so they shouldnt be on peoples land.

3	thatit can be managed to minimise impact. freedomcamping is a great enabler to the outdoors.
3	thats what camping in nz is all about
0	the  best. most rapid way to protect nature.but i want my freedom. only for me....
4	the actions of a few idiots should not ruin it for the majority who are respectful
4	the actions of a few shoudnt destroy it for the many. educate and govern rather than ban
0	the animals die fromthe peaple wild
1	the camping should have moerestrictions and designated sites to protect all native and local wildlife.
1	the cost ofcleanup time money manpowerthe effect on environment. leaving yourrubbish is against the kiwi value
4	The earth is for us all to enjoy... money should not be a prequesite
2	THE ENVIRMENT IS GONE ALLREADY SO YEAH
0	the enviroment is VERY inportant and that we sould take more care of it and pepole shouldnt throw rubish or leave human waste its just not cool
3	THE ENVIRONMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PERSONAL FREEDOM.
1	The environment is more important than trampers having fun.
0	the environment is themost important thing
1	the environment needs to be card for
0	the environment should come before tourism
3	the environmentis damgedby the minority who dobt respect it. i freedom camp but do it proprly. u shouldprosecutethose wo dont
1	the few have let the true freedom campers who respect nature down.  its always the few who ruin it for most
3	the few ruin it for the ones who take care. if banning can you not put same penalties as banning for camping if they leave a mess.
1	the freedom campers wreck the places they stay at.
4	the freedom camping act should be recinded and local council again permitted to dictate where is safe for the environment
4	The freedom to easily enjoy the beauty of our country far outweighs the negative effects as long as most are doing it responsibly
0	the future of everything that makes nz unique depends on it
3	THE GOVERMENT IS COMING WATCH OUT!! MR MIDNIGHT IS MAKING MY BLOOD BOIL
1	THE GT SHOUD JUST POVIDE AFFORDABLE CAM SITES WITH PROPER FACILITIES
4	The impact freedom camping has is a drop in the ocean compared to transport, construction and farming. Freedom campers are an easy target which doesnât affect corporations and other politics. Freedom camping attracts tourism and boosts GDP, never mind the enormous lifestyle gains
4	the impat of freedom camping is minimal compared to industries such as mining and logging and so many more. Banning freedom camping is also criminalising homelessness
1	The important distinction to make is freedom camping instead of all camping. People can still connect to nature in regulated campgrounds and the environment here must be protected. I am from AUS and the environment there is suffering. You have done so well here comparatively.
3	The kind of people that go freedom camping are usually enviromentally aware. It wouldn't be too hard to educate more people on the subject.
4	the land should be enjoyed responsibly
4	the majority of campers are responsible. it shouldnt be banned because of a thoughtless minority. ebetter education would be a more appropriate solution
4	the majority of campers is acting responsible. alongpublic road a lot of rubbish can be found too... but we are not banning cars either right?
4	The majority of campers ive met so far do care about keeping the environment clean and are responsible.
0	the mess they leave is shocking
1	the minority that abuse freedom camping do enough damage that it should be discussed and compromises made
1	the more human waset that goes into our enviroment. the quicker earthwill die :(
4	the most amount of tourists from overseas freedom camp as wellas many nzers. i thik it actually brings them closer to and develops more of an appreciatiob for our beautifulnature
4	the most people who do freedom camping are comitted tothe ules and really love nature!
3	the nature benefits to every one. It .is healthy. But we have to take care of it and return all our garbage.
1	the nature is a sight to see so i think we should keep it alive
4	The only thing I asked you to do for this party was put on clothes and you didn't DO it.
4	The people are always going to find a way to mess up the environment no matter what is prohibited. Better to work on policing rather take away peoples freedoms.  Give people the chance to see and then love and care for NZ.
3	The people should be banned. Use cameras for this.
4	the people should own the land
0	the planet is in troubleand the survival of these animals and their significance to the ecosystem matters more than the opportunity to check something off of some hipsters bucket list
4	the problem is invasive species not campers
4	the problem is not freedom caming. the problem is uneducted people acting disrespectfully. dont ruin it for everyone else. always respect the environment
4	the problem is the people not the rules or the locatons. just be more responsible humans
4	the problem it is not the freedom camping but the lack of knowledge on how to behave in a place where nobody clean after yourself.
1	the pros out way the cons
1	the punishments cold be made alot wore to incourage
1	the qeustion is too simplistic. Some paraneters need to be applied to allow NZ citizens the privilege of enjoying the freedom of our outdoor spaces but with very specific limitations to protect our wheuua and mauri.
3	the rubbish that is left behind is horrible for the enviroment
4	the small few ruin it for the rest of the respectul New Zealanders who take great care and pride in their country
0	the time is passed when this was acceptable
0	the top 10 holiday park was amazing
3	the tourists keep leaving rubbish which is bad.
1	the unmatched beauty of this natural environment should be preserved even if we need to stayout of some areas
4	the world is a blank cnvas to sleep where i want
2	the world is going to die
3	thecamping is a beautiful thing and disproportionally affects the poor.
1	then it means someone care enough to about the environment to think about this plan
4	then it will only be for the rich
4	there are a lot of great places ib nz should be harder fines for people that do wrong thing
4	there are bigger threats to wildlife and freedom campng helps create a love for aturethat will hopefully make uscare abot it
3	there are campgrouds where people can stay
1	there are enough options on asigned campinggrounds. respectnature
3	There are lots responsible NZers who freedom camp properly and get to enjoy this great country
2	there are many other things that kill our environment other than freedom camping. homless peopledo not have muchchoices these day. why take away their onechanc to survive without issue. you want change.  Get rid of crooked politicians and their jet planes first.
3	there are many people who are respectful and cantake careofnature
1	there are many whotake pride in our land and tidy up while camping
3	there are much more harmful things than freedom camping to the envronment like burning col or packinging teabags
3	there are not enough people to police this activity so even if it is banned it will still happen.
4	there are people that wont litter afer a good trip. also if people want to litterthen they will do it anywhere
1	there are plenty of camp grounds in amazing locations where there are bins and it iseasir to keep the area clean
0	there are plenty of huts and tours. nature is more important than self important tourists.
4	there are so many other ways to prevent littering .. stop blaming climate crisis on us little people
2	there are some that ruin it for all but still a lot that try to respect the environment. Banning freedom camping can come at the detriment of the tourism sector. Many job positions are filled by those working to fund their trip including agricultural sector.
3	there are stil plenty of responsible people who knows howto do the campingin the good way
0	there are too many people doing it and it puts a lot of pressure on the environment.
3	There are too many people who like camping for this to work
3	there are ways to sustainably freedom camp
3	there can be fredom camping without human waste. just because people right now dont care doesnt mean that  all people are like that.
1	there exist many reasonable solutions to  the current ecological crises but we need enforced policy and legislation to provide lasting change
4	THERE IS A LONG LIST OF OTHER THINGS TO BAN FIRST. THAN USE THIS AS AN EXCUSE TO REMOVE MORE HUMAN FREEDOMS
3	there is a place for freedom camping providing that people act responsibly to respect and protect the environment
1	There is a responsibility to the land we inherit
4	there is a smallminority of people who abuse the freedom caming. those people should befined. bt those of us who go camping and resect  our environment in doing so should not be banned as to is an amazing and cheap way to see the beauty out country has to offer
1	there is already too much waste in environment
1	there is momentum  building to really examine the impacts of all our activities including camping. and we can develop new ways of doing things.
1	there is no accountability for the campers and how the dispose of their waste or where they stay regarding tapu places or significant areas.
3	there is no reason to make this decision if people are respectful
4	There is nothing wrong with responsible freedom camping.My question to TePapa what if anything has this remit git to do with you. 
2	there is other things that are doing more damage
4	there is the capability and econoic benifits to  facilitate and encourage responsible freedom camping. tourism is our second largest income producer in NZ.  All we need is a car park rubish bin and toilet. my tax pays for that sort of thing.
0	there isnt enough infrastructure to keep them where intended they jus do what they want
3	there needs to be more protection of the enviroment but freedom camping is an incredible way to experience nz
3	there seems to be no consequences for people who dont care for our environment.
3	there should be a place for it but people need to share care and respect
4	there should be a right to roam. instead of banning - educate people to leave no trace from a young age like scandanavia
4	There should be a rule where littering is not aloud.
1	there should be areas where campers can safely park and have apropriate toilet facilities
4	there should be education so thatfredom caminggcan be done responsibly and sustainibly
3	there should be more monitoring and education of terms so people can camp whilst still being respectful of the envrnment
3	there should be no waste caps and it should be banned
0	there should be places designated for freedom camping around nz. Then good education and advertisng
3	there shouldbeway morec rules and cars should NOT be turned int self contained. however a larger good setup should be fine
4	there will alway be people who leave their rubbishand human waste behind but most freedom campers and campers in general really care about leaving no trace on their journey
1	there will be less litter and it will be better
3	there willbe a disconnect with nature. we shouldinstead inform of waste and make waste disposal easier
1	there wouldbeno issue with freedom camping if everyone respected ther country ad took all rubbish away with them
0	thereare too many people that do not clean up after themselves.
0	theres camp grounds for a reasn
3	theres more to regulations could be done. the cost of banning is massive  to the economy
4	theres nothing wrong withitif done respectfully

4	they just want a cheap holiday
3	they leave their paru behind and do not care of the consequences. kia mahara ki te he o Rona.
4	they leave their rubbish and shit everywhere
3	they might kill animals for food andmake then extinkt
1	They pollute areas with leftover trash and disrespect the land
0	they poop everywhre and leave there stuff everywhere
3	they shit everywhere and leave rubbish
4	they should do as they want housing shortage makes people homeless and immagrants take nz housing
1	they should restrict them and place rules
4	they should take care of the enviroment cause we haveto suffer ur consiquinces
1	they shouldhave cheap or free DOC sites with basic facilities toallowaffordable but sustainable camping
4	they think of themselves and ther comfort atthe detriment of our natural eco system. selfish and thoughtless human beings
1	thi will stop pollution and keep our water clean
4	THINK ABOUT IT.  FREEDOM MEANS WHAT?
4	think how your house has been build. be worryabout the milk industry. the fossil industry. implement recycling. new zealand need to upgrade itself.
1	think people shuld always feel hope in them
1	thinking about ways to protect nature makes me hopeful but i believe it should be more regulated but not stopped. it is a way for people to appreciate nz nature and this fosters compassion for the environment.
1	this ban seems quite restrictive and limiting on the geberal population however i do think it it could heavily benefit our environment i the future
1	this change needs to be made
1	this ciuld redue things like climatechange
4	this country and our enviroment gains nothing from these people. they just degrade ourenviroment. they are pigs.
0	this is a fun and  cool place
1	this is a great idea because our wildlife is alreadysufering at our expence. Wile affordable travel opions may be a down side freedom camping is free so losing that would not halt any money entering our toreim indistry
1	This is a great idea to keep our enviroment and earth safe. The native wildlife deserves peace and clean spaces to call home. How would you likeit if people were invading your home?
1	this is a great way to explore nature but  look after it. Take away any RÅªBBÄªSH WÄªTH YÅÅª
0	this is a strong idea and contributes to a lower carbon level which is brilliant
3	this is an essential way to connect with the environment
0	this is because freedom campig maydamage the enviormet which makes me excited to the ide of it beibg banned
4	this is bob again. you poo!!!
4	this is great to explore the country
3	This is not supported by evidence. ie you cannot possibly know the percentage of people who dont litter; so this responce of banning is disproportional and suggests lazy policy making by officials looking for "quick wÄ«ns".
4	this is not the only to protect the atmoshere but rather a poitcics
3	this is not the solution. the problem is human behaviour. people keep putting rubish everywhere. that needs attention.
3	this is part of nz  control it don.tban it
0	this is the right way to protect us
4	this is why global warming is getting worse
4	this makes me so angry. dont ruin traverlerslifes. itsthe reason people still travel
3	This seems like a band-aid strategy.
4	this shoulde well controlled asmost campers arevery  careless and dont look after ourenvioremnt and resorses
0	this will be a big step up to making people nore aware of the enviroment and the dangers we represent to it
1	this will be better for the environment
0	this will hopefully help the environment so we can breathe fresh air which i think is important
1	this will play a part in enviromental waste. controlled camping will prevent wildlife endangarment and polution
3	this would be bad becase if not evrybody were able to freely camp there may be homeless people that cant afford to camp or be able to go get a permit and thats just one of the reasons in conclusion im very much worried for the local washington.
1	thiscause of action mmay lead o lessrubish in the environmebt
3	those that respe the whenua should beable to freedom camp
0	tiakina te taiao te mea nui
0	TIKI I MURI I A KOE HIE KIWI PAI MAURI ORA
1	time to put the whenua first!
1	tinu i think that the environment should be more aking seriously. I hope that in the future the enviroment wil be part of our life. Now i think we have been more careful about this problem and i hope that will continue.
3	to ban it completly would not be the best solution to me. i hope to believe that most of the freedom campers are respectful and i think we should try to sensiblise the people
4	to ban people from travelingvthrough our country is wrong
4	to be able to camp on the land is a human right
4	to be closer to nature teaches respect. commodification ofnature is part of the problem
1	to be honest i have mixed feeling aboutths statement
1	to educate the people that camps how to protect our environment. without harmng nature andanimals
3	to fully admire nz wonders it is so secial to hear the quiet  not surrounded by so many
4	TO MANY PEOPLE  DONT REALIZE HOW MUCH DAMAGE THEY DO BY THROWING OUT A GUM WRAPPER  DOWN A CITYDRAIN
0	to many pepe leave there rubbish round
3	to much  damage to the environment.
1	to protect birds nd other animalstha could go etinked in later dated
0	To protect habitats and reduce spread of rubbish
2	TO PROTECT NATURE IS IMPORTANT. BUT TO ENJOY WITH IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT ACTIVITY.
1	to protect nzand keep nz clean and beautiful
1	TO PROTECT OUR NATIVE WILDLIFE - MORE LEVIES NEED TO BE INTRODUCED TO FUND CONSERVATION EFFORTS
0	to protect our natural environments for future generations
3	TO PROTECT THE NATURE YOU HAVE TO LOVE AND EXPERIENCE IT. THE BEST POSSIBIITY TO  DO THAT IS IF YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME OUTSIDE. THE PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT POLLUTION AND THEIR EFFECTS. THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE FINED. BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL THE NATURE SHOULDNT BE BANNED
0	to protect theenviorment does that mean we eat our rubish like my friend?:D
2	to quitfreedom camping probbly wont make a big difference and freedom camping dose not harm our envirment terribly
0	to safeguard the environment for future generations
2	to small a factor and many people try to leave nothing
3	to some aspect it brings more money and tourists to our country especially those not as fortunate as the rest. it allows them freedom like the world allows us but then on the other side its difficult because the people who take advantage of this treat take advantage  of us/NZ
1	to sustain our already declining enviroment of the whenua for my mokopuna
3	to understand nature you need to be close to it and thereby respect for it will occur
1	too many do not respect the environment
1	too many new campers who dont know best practices
3	too many people dont think about their imact
1	too much mess pollution and bad behavior
4	too much regulation. IT PENALISES THE POOR AND DISADVANTAGED
1	too much rubbish being dumped and nature being ruined.
1	too much rubbish left everywhere in the nature...
4	totally stupid ppl should be able to see the coubtry whilst freedom camping gt fkd
4	tourisim industry relies on freedom camping and tourists. Distribute more waste dumping sites and rubish bins to reduce unlawful rubish dumping. People sleeping in their cars isnt killing kiwi.GRRRRRRR
3	tourism in nz is tailored for the wealthy already for some freedom camping is the only affordableway to see our own country. removing freedom camping makes this country exclusively for the wealthy even more.
3	tourism industywould be at risk. people enjo camping in nz without paying extreme prices for accomidation.
4	tourism is important for growth and education
4	tourism should not just be for the priveledged
1	tourismneeds to b managed in a way soit does not negatively impact the enviornment
0	tourist dont look after our land so they dont get to enjoy it. it sucks but conservation above all else
1	Tourists camping withou infrastructure ruins it for all

4	toursts dont leave rubbish' locals do
0	tree kee us alive so i think it should
2	u dont have money why u care
4	unfortunately freedom campers who leave a trace of their visit spoil itfor those who do respect the environment
1	unfortunatly weare not behaving responsible enough without a ban i am hopefull ithelps
1	Unless areas are policed by local auhorities (which is the best solution) then it neds to end
0	unless people can find a way to freedon camp in a way that affects the envonment positively  it sould be banned
3	unless we.teach people to respect and enjoy our environment we will never make progress inconservation
0	until people are taught to camp responsibly they should not be allowed to camp outside designated areas  . erhaps there could be a pass system where once a class has been taken a person can then freedom camp
4	ur all snowflÄkes grow a spine
0	ur mum lol and deez nutz
4	us youngins want to explore for cheap yall would ruin that
4	used freedom camping all over new zealand when i was a teen and in my twentys.  All the camps enviorments were respected back then and im sure the same today.  banning them will just lead to commericalization.  commericalized camp grounds have been the worse camp grounds ive seen
4	very dissapointed in humanity ko warch this it gon be ruthless
3	VIEWAlot of people pull up to the areas were camping at and drink and so forth leaving rubbsish ans we get the blame. i think tidy people shouldnt get punished. theres nothing better than waking up to a true nz view
1	Visited a plce recently and felt so...
1	waste from people not caring for enviroment
4	we  won't be able to go on holiday and have fun on are days off!

3	when people leav there rubish itbecome part of the earth and ruins it
4	when you are angry you wont be able to dogood things
4	when you connect with land you better care for it
1	while i enjoy camping nz provides huts. proper use of these can limit our collective footprints. yet a range of freedom camping option must be provided. huts are not accessible to all.
1	while i think that banning freedomcamping would benefit the environment i am worried about the implications for those struggling to find shelter and the consequences for them.
1	While limiting peoples freedom to explore the environment isnt ideal for travelling I think its beneficial to reducing climate change and making New Zealand a more liveable place.
1	Whilst it isimportant to engage people with nature so theycontinue tocare the protection of nature must come first.

4	why ban people trying to live in nature like humans once did
1	why cant we stick to normal camping?
4	Why do we feel the need to gatekeep and caitilise our whenua
4	why have a bautiful country if you cannot getout and be in it. experience is the kiwi way. we should teach stewardship and not just ban living in our beautiful country
2	why just why like people like to camp
3	why limit pure experience with nature..? responsabiliy is the key?
0	why not use designated spots tha are regulated
4	why ruin for everyone because of the few who neglect their duty
4	why should it be banned some people can only afford tents and not houses or fancy hotels
2	why should it ne band its mine lol
4	why should not we be able to camp
3	why should we rob the mjority of people of a wounderfull thing  just because a few dont behave as they should?  where will we end  if we keep doing that with everything ?
2	whyis there not an idk button
3	Will people actually listen? It seems like a hard thing to monitor and enforce. I hope it works though!
1	will protect more bu people that rubbish willbstilldo it ...
2	with larger fears concernicing the enviroment limiting peronal freedom is ineffective in producing the rapid change needed to save the enviroment
1	without clear defined areas high risk of  rubbish and damaging of the nature
3	without guidance people destroy precious places. if they can do the right thing itsok tofreedom camp!!
3	worried about all the animals and it is not good for  the  environment
3	worried about the fauna and flora because we are not concious about the endangered species
3	worried bcause it brings travellers on a budget here. i wouldnt be here today if i wasnt allowed to camp nearby.
3	worried that with freedom camping being banned that this could lead to a people illegally freedom camping anyway if there is no physical  form of protection to actually stop  them.
3	would ruin for tidy kiwi freedom campers
4	wrong government evil the world is a lie
3	wrong way to deal with the issue. better waste facilities and education on environmental awareness shoud be prioritised
0	yay plop goob . seriousy it isfor da bettrrrrr
4	yellow sausage rolls tatelike camel hairs
4	yes i agree with the issues around rubbsh and polution of th enviroment. But the concept of camping in its simplist form is part of who weare as Kiwis. Loving the environment is just about conserving but also enjoying and being immersed in it
1	yes lmao its goodecause people destroy environment. lol
4	yet another example of over regulation
0	YOU ARE A POO OF MY DOG
