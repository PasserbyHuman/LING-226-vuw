1	cayts  are not cute and cudly they are hunters and there are too many  Åf them in NZ
1	cies are nativCats although a common house pet for many do tend to kill native animals. I believe it is most important to protect species endemic and native to NZ before protecting and favouring those introduced Cats can survive almost anywhere in the world. Native species cannot
1	city cats are ok but if we lived rural near native bush would definitely keep them indoors at night
1	coeito action.This could be a verygood idea but cats are the kind of pets that need execise and time outdoors so maybe a specific 'cat only' area in each suberb. I think that it would help widlife (particuarly birds) to recover as well and we do really need more ideas like this.
1	Collarcams and poo studies show owners only see a tiny fraction of what their cats catch - even well fed, belled cats - plus indoor cats, and their owners, are healthier https://theconversation.com/one-cat-one-year-110-native-animals-lock-up-your-pet-its-a-killing-machine-138412
3	collars for residential areas. And no cats around native areas
3	Confining cats to a life indoors is not natural. However I believe that cat owners need to be responsible re having their cats desexed and keeping them indoors at night

3	does that mean any cat in cat family so yall want tigers in your home??
2	dogs a mans best friend. cats dont need us
4	dogs and all animals can be inside not just cats
1	Doing something that has a chance to benefit the cat as well as create an opportunity for other species seems a positive solution.
0	domestic animals are unecessarilydamaging ourenvironment SHOUDBE INDOORSBORBANNEDALTOGETHER
1	domestic animals should stay in their environment
3	domestic cats would not be happy to be kept indoors especially at night. they are nocturnal by natre
3	Domesticated cats are not even saboteurs of nature
0	Domesticated cats dont belong outdoors as they either hurt themselves or fight with other cats
4	domesticcats are notgoing to decimate bird populations but government decisions to coverforests with highly toxic poisons are . so how aboutwe keepthese people locked up
4	dont be so stupid.GET RID of rats stoats possums rabbits FIRST
2	dont care. still dont care. i dont care
3	dont demonise resonsible pet ownership.cats more ikely to hunt at nght. keep them in at night
4	dont hold a cat if it cant stroll around itis also an animal with needs so just dont  be that selfish to hold a cat in new zealand
1	Due to thedomestic nature of modern cats refrainingthem from the outdoors seemslike a win-win situation.
4	each n every one have a right to live
1	Endangered animals need to be protected
3	epeople will need educating to provide for cats species specific needs indoors eg enrichment diet toys cat trees heat pads litter boxes cat body language etc to ensure they arent suffering . supported by qualified clinical animal behaviorists eg hannah sadgrove
3	established outdoors cats would not be happy and theywould be sad
3	even pets should have the right to some freedom
0	even though I love cats they dont belong in NZ as they pose a threatto our beautiful fauna
4	every animal has a righ to live everywhere it wants
0	every cat needs supervision. apart from mittens. hesthe king of wellington
0	every little help counts if that is going to stop the native fauna from disappearing
3	everyone deserves to be outside so they can have  fresh air like we humans dohow would you feel if we werent allowed to go outside and hade to stay in for ever. I DONT THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE AND I DEFFINITLY  KNOW THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE IT

4	ferral cats can be culled but well feed domestic cats should NOT be kept inside
1	for protection of native endemic species
0	for purpose of protecting birds in native environment in NZ
4	freeits really sad that humans have introduced predators to begin with now from trying to protect other animals from them it is the animals that are suffering. cats should be allowed the right to roam free as much as any animal. humans need to learn a lesson

1	great idea for cats to stay inside during the day
1	hard to  do but important to protect birds
0	Having a pet is a big responsibility. And if dogs are not allowed to wander ouround unsupervised then cats shouldnt either. They damage our ecosystem too much.
0	honestly cats overpopulate nz and destroy our native species...whÄn ÄllÅwÄd tÅ roam freely
1	hopeful means that you hope for something
1	hopeful that people take responcibility.   i think if we spade our cats it will lead to less wild cats.  wild cats i guess kill more native birds than domestic cats
1	hopefully my tests comeback negative for coronavirus
1	hopful that we can stop the extinction of more species.
1	how do you feel about this idea
0	how many birds would still be killed if cats all had bells and collars?   is that an accetable number?
3	how practical is it?  Technologyshoudbelooked at and funded ie wearable devices to prevent cats catching birds
3	humans are not just inside as well everyone sould have the option to go outside
4	humans are the biggest prblem of this world NOT animals
4	humans do more damage to wild life than cats.
4	Humans should not dictate the life a cat should have. Neither should they interfere with the natural food chain process. Quality of life for the cat is an important factor especially when one of 5 animal needs to meet if you own an animal is to let them exhibit natural behaviour
3	humans wont be ableo control sneaky rats
4	HUMEN SHOULD NOT DECIDE ABOUT OTHER LIFE BEINGS LIFE
0	i  think cats are a wasre of space. our heritage is far too precious.
1	I  think it's a good idea!
3	I  think it's unrealistic. It will take a generation to changethe habits and love affairs of a lifetime.
3	I  think no living creature should be locked up in a house.
1	I  think that it should be kept inside because it could be danngerous for the birds.
3	I  THINK THAT WE SHOULD KEEP OUR NATIVE BIRDS PROTECTED
0	i  think you should kill them all
1	I  want to eat Japanese food.
1	I agree cats should be kept indoors around reserves and bush
4	i am angry    that cats aretaking our birds away from the   clouds and nector.
4	i am angry becauselots of valuable and cute birds were wiped out because the human population'
4	i am angry that cats are taking our bird to take away the clouds necter to helpus see our sky. i do not like cats are eating our birds birds help us alot.
2	i am being photographed without my consent
3	i am conflicted I love our birds and encourage them to my garden with native species etc. BUT I  also enjoy my feline companion. there must be a way  to allow both to exist. A  high tec but safe collar??to distract or emit an unpleasant sound to disrupt cat from its prey.
2	i am getting corona virus as i touch this machine -
1	I am hopeful about this idea
1	i am hopeful and i think we should have fences in are garden so they dont kill any dirds
1	i am hopeful because i like birds
1	I am hopeful because then the bird popultion can recover and the cats won't have to get hurt.
1	I am hopeful but only if it is proven to be a happy and healthy life for cats

4	I am very triggered when liberals infringe on my rights
3	i am worried becaues we need birds for to take necter from clouds for seeing our sky. i do not thik it is ok only becaues i say cats a predertes or wiled but if it has a owner it will be fed good so that is my worrys
3	i am worried because we  need birds to take nectare from clouds for seeingour sky.Ä« dÅ nÅtlÄ«kÄ cÄts ÄÄtÄnbÄ«rds bÅ«tÄ«f Ä«thÄdÄ ÅwnÄr Ä«t shÅÅ«ld bÄ fÄd rÄÄlly gÅÅd.
3	I am worried for the native birds as they are so important to our country. Although i think that making cats only indoor is also unfair on them.
3	I Believe animals need outdoors for survival and happiness. a solution would be an area branching from the house for the cat to still have the comfort of being outside (the area being enclosed). we as humans can benefit it too. we can harvest plants without worry of birds.
4	i believe the children are our future
1	i belive it would be a good idear because cas case so much harm to our native wildlife. cats are also an introduced spesices and ts nt fairon native wild lif if e let them hunt. or atlesat make sure all cas wear blls and stay in at ngth.
3	I cannot see cats staying inside.Best to make sure ALL cats wear bells
2	i dislike animals and animals dislike me. bye felisha . Humans are alrady annoyinh animals
1	I do hope this helps New Zealand native birds to survive. However I do feel sorry for the cats. I do have a cat in Munich-Germany. My cat would go depressive without the outdoor option.

0	I dont like cats killing birds
0	i dont like cats. they are jerks
2	I dont mind cats wondering around where I used to live. I dont consider it a problem. Give cats their freedom if they want and leave them be.
2	I don't own a cat, and care more about the environment.
0	i dont really like cats and they are dangeours for birds
0	i dont really rate cats but ido like biodiverdity
3	I don't think cat owners understand thir responsibility and the actions to go there are rather immense.
3	i dont think its fair to restrict an animal
3	I dont think that law aound making cats indoor only is realistic.
2	I dont want to own a cat
0	i feel excited  because it  will help the bird
1	I feel like even though there will be resistance, there is a groundswell of people out there who know we need to do something to help our birds.
0	I feel this is achievable for the preservation of all life.
3	i feel worried because jjust am
0	i hate cats and  i don want to see thm
2	i hate cats they poopin your bootiful Garden
1	I hate it when my cat kills a bird. I'm hopeful that we can train our cats to stay inside.
1	I hate the impact cats have on the environment and natural species
0	i have 4    cÄts whÄ«ch Ä« sÄw bÄÄ«ng bÅrn Ä«n Ä«stÄnbÅ«l....ÄftÄr Äll thÄÄ«r  pÄpÄrwÅrk ..whÄ«ch tÄkÄs 3 months   Ä« drÅvÄ thÄm home to scotland......mine are housecats.....safe and sound

1	i have a cat and i  let him in side
3	I have a cat and she lives outside. She does kill birds and that worries me. But she also kills mice and rats which is important for the pest control around our home.
0	i have a couple pet birds and i love them so much and i care about birds and i dont need them to go extinct so i think cat shoud be indoor pets only

1	I LIKE CATS .but in this context i hope it will be better. to conservate ecosystem.
1	I LIKE CATS BUT THEY KILL BIRDS AND POO IN MY BACKYARD
2	i like them insde and outsde
0	i live in america where indoor cats are the norm. keeping your cat indoors can extend their lives by years and help protect native fauna!
1	I live in the Coromandel and wouldn't consider getting a cat here because of the amazing wildlife on my doorstep here. Cats are great and I grew up with pet cats but I think that indoors is the way to go if we want the bird life to thrive!
1	I love being visited by my neighbours cats but cats are one of the only 'pest' species we actually have control over. We should take this responsibility seriously and do more to look after native wildlife.
0	I love cats but their effect on wildlife is devastating. Making cats indoor only allows usto enjoy all animals -amazing feline pets and amazing wildlife.
1	i love cats but they dont belong here
0	i love cats however theyareone of the biggest threats to our birds.
0	I love cats. They are exceptional hunters. Responsible owners should keep them in at night for their own safety as well as native animals
4	i love my cat ! would YOU like to be cooped up in a cage??!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	i love my cat and want her to have a life outside but i love native birds and want them to flourish. maybe if there was a law  for cats to be inside the descision would be made for me. my cat also kills a lot of  native skinks
3	i love my cats and keep them inside from dusk to dawn
0	i love pets i hate when there outside i love huggingtem inoors..#  not sponcered
3	i love the birds but cats cant live a half life indoors. but i cant bear the incredible birds dieing. i just dont know.
2	i own a cat but would keep her inside to preserve birdlife
1	I really think birds are the best!!!!
0	i theyre distructive carnivores simple as that.
3	i thibk there should be an immediate ban on cats entering the country ....   and all similar such predators.  the cats that live here already should have a safe space to end their days.  all female cats  should be sterilised.
4	i thik cats shoukd goutside whenever theyat want
1	I THINK ALL CATS ARE PREDATORY. THEY WANT TO KILL US TOO.
1	I think all cats should be loved and cared for because they are beautiful animals!!
0	I think all cats sould be banned. #dogsrule
4	i think because ct eat wild ife birds. but then cat should be streeted like people
0	i think because it is safer for the cats and they can be a lot more healthy and have not as much stress about finding their way back home if they have been let out
1	i think birds have the right to live.
2	i think cats are mean so i would not care if i did not see them anymore
3	I think cats are meant to live outdoor. I mean you would not put birds into a cage. They are made to fly. CHANGE MY MIND
0	I think cats are safest inside. It is best for their own health ando ther animals safey
2	i think cats are so great. My name is M####. I am 22 and sometimes as a furry i dress up as one
3	i think cats belong oudside and only if they want they can come inside.
4	i think cats have the same right to be outside as every other animal
0	i think cats kill millions of birds and amphibians
0	i think cats kill too many native birds
3	I think cats should be allowed freedom
4	i think cats should be aloud to go were they what
3	i think cats should be indoor at night only and maybe you need a cat permit also compolsory neutering unless you are a breeder. most cats would be miserable if indoors always and most nz houses not suitable for keeping cat inside only.
1	i think cats should be kept in at nights
4	i think cats should enjoy the outside because i think they only have onlife
1	i think cats should not be trapped inside
1	I THINK CATS SHOULD REMAIN INSIDE IF NOT LOOKED AFTERBY THEIR OWNERS
0	i think cats should stay indoors as we can reduce population and cats health
3	i think cats were born to explore the outside world. beingstrictly inside may lead to depression and anxiety for the pet therefore leading to  anunhealthy animal. vet fees etc.
2	i think catscan do what ever they want
0	I think catsshould be well taken care of and the responsbility of their owner. The best way to do this is indoor.
0	i think cull all ferals ( introduced)
3	i think i will be a snge mun
3	i think i would be complicated but it s a good idea
4	i think if we want to make cats indoor cause they kill birds we have to make humans indoor too cause we eat animals and kill them too
0	i think is a good idea
2	i think it depend on your cat and what it prefers and if it knows the area it  lives in and is not vicious
0	i think it is a good idea.
4	i think it is like keeping a whale in an aquarium.  we should instead encourage cat owners to put bells on the cats so they can ntsneak up on birds
3	i think it is worrisome that we feel we should interfere with the natural world based on our ideological framework.
1	i think it may help some endangered species of bird to recover
1	i think it well help the balance of nature
0	i think it would be amazing
0	i think it would be better to get rid of all cats. too much risk
3	i think its an excellent idea
3	i think its better to have cat and dog free housing areas in some places near special wild or conservationareas but not all. its not fair to not let cats out during the day but they should be kept in at night.
1	i think its definitely something  that needs to happen but im only hopeful because it wont happen soon enough
1	i think its good for birds to survive but it is sad that cats cant get exercise in there own way and time and place so ima bit worried
4	i think its important that I kaele
1	I think its mportant to show the sheer impact they have.
4	i think melodie shouldnt have stood on her kitten
1	i think more breadingcontrol measuresshould be introduced
4	I think my car deserves to go outside
0	i think our birds insects and reptiles are too precious a toanga to loose any more to extinction.  We need to be brave couragious warriors each one doing the mahi to save our native species
1	I think our birds makegreat outdoor companions and we need toprotect them
0	i think people should be responsible for their pets acts.  and if they are outdoors is very hard to take proper care. native fauna is more important in this matter.
1	i think pets owners should pick up after their pets.  cat  owners typically dont
1	i think saving endemic nature and animals is paramount
4	i think shawn mendes should be allowed in every country
4	i think that  its not good to loose most of our birds
3	i think that a cat is supposed tobea outdoor animal thats what theirused for to be a outdoor pet that hunts. it would be sad if they were idoor
1	i think that although this would benefit ourecosystem  immensely.. hwÄvÄr Ä« thÄ«nk thÄt Ä« Ä«swrÅng tÅ kÄÄp cÄts Ä«bdÅÅrs
2	i think that cats a always hunter
0	I think that cats are bringing down the native birds population and that this shouldbe put into affect immediately.
0	i think that cats are not domestic animals and should not exposeany risks to nativ animals.
0	I think that cats aren't alays the best for ou environment
1	i think that cats like spaggeti
3	I THINK THAT CATS NEED EXERSIZE OUTSIDE
4	i think that cats need nature. ya know
1	i think that cats normally should be able to go outside. But in NZ they should stayathome or somehow in the garden because they kill so many native animals.
1	i think that cats should be able to go outside to see the world
3	i think that cats should nt be kept inside but i alsothink thatprotcting  the native brds is important
1	i think that cats should stop killing animalsthat are not anoying you but meg and maisie are fine.
1	I think that it is cool and that one day the future generation can learn from this.
1	i think that it is good idea but i dont think that its going to be successful
3	I think that it would help if we could keep them inside but then they might to kill  more because they're stuck inside.
1	I think that it's worth trying. If it turns out that cats are a big problem and keeping them inside helps our birds then yes I think it might be a good idea. If not then they canbe free. But we won't know until we've tried.
0	i think that they are useful to kill the rats. but not the birds.....
1	I Think that you should be able to take them out on a leash during the day; but keep them in during the night when the cats usually hunt
4	i think thatit is not fair as they need space too
3	i think thatit is scary that we have tomake cats inside animals because their natural habitat is outside so it is horrible that we have to take that away from them but it is to protect out native wildlife so i think we have to do some thing
3	i think the birds need a space for live they life proprely and in peace
3	i think the cat would go mad
1	i think there should be a law to sterilize cats
0	i think they are dangerous pets justlike rats. Our society tolerated them in NZ so far only because cats are part of our European culture (where most of cst lovers from) but in reality they dont fit this ecosystem.
2	i think they carry diseases so yeah thats why pooop
0	i think they should remain indoor domestic pets for their own protection as well as the enviorment protection.
0	I think this because cats are amazing creatures
1	I think this idea is on the right track but not quite right. There should also be an option to have an outdoor "run" for cats. Something that allows them the freedom to go outside and sit in the sun but that separates them from birds. A neighbour of mine has one for her cat and it works really well.
1	i think this is a good idea as so much native wildlife is threatened. but what kind of a life is it for an animal trapped indoors. would conservation ever suggest to keep the birds kept inside?
0	I think this is a great idea because cats should leave birds alone
3	I think this s a good and bad ideas yes we do need to protect our nature and wild life but cats need a life and freedom too.
0	i think this will save native wildlife
2	i think very strongly on this matter
3	I think we mustnot keep cats inside because  they deserve to be kept inside they are originally wild animals until humans captivated them.
1	i think we need to protect native animals
1	i think we need to protect our birdlife. this may be a sacrifice we need to consider.
1	i think we need to protect the native birds before our love for domestic pets
2	i wanna see the buubles move
1	i want my grandchildren  to see this world as i have
1	i want native birdlife back in cities in NZ
4	i want the human species to be extinct. that will solve all the problems.
1	i want to fist fight very cat until i becme the most powerfu thing on land
1	i want to save the native birds
3	i wont birds to be alive because when you know it they will be exitnt and then we wont have any mbirds and the people that love birds and take care of then the we be very sad because cats are kill thenarekkklkillingkillbirdsq
0	I would like our native wildlife to be there in 5 years thankyouverymuch
0	i would love for my cat to be indoors ll the time!!
1	I would not like to see them harmed. I realise they are taking over in many cases, and they are a risk to our Birdlife. I would want the best for Cats...How do we contain an animal that is born to travel, investigate, find new families and have adventures. Yet I see the risk they may present
3	I WOULD PREFER NOT HAVING ONE AT ALL THAN KEEPING IT INSIDE. BUT I AM PRETTY CONCERNED ABOUT HELPING NATIVE ANIMALS ! SO NO CAT FOR ME :)
1	iam allergic to cats. they give me itchy eyse so them beinng indoors would be nice
1	ibeiev that cats can dstroy too many native animals and should be restricted during the night
3	id feel bad for cats as they are natural hunters and part of the world evolving isadly includes a little bit of species death. sup humans
0	I'd love to have more native birds around my house.
2	idk if we should do that
0	if cats are ebdabgering wildlife then these pets should not be allowed to hunt freely.
4	if cats are going to kill birds thats life. we dont hear anything about killing cows or lambs do we. although keeping cats iside from dangerous driving would be saving both cats and birds. therefore why dont we humans just stay inside. (:
1	If cats are kept indoors it means they become less of a serious preditor to native and endemic NZ species.
3	if cats are kept indoors they will lose their natural instincts
1	if cats are responsible for decimating our native bird populations they should be indoor pets.
0	if every cat owner was a responsible eco citizen then cats would be confined indoors of an evening  and would have a diminished impact on wildlife numbers.
4	if i back it up... is it fat enough?
0	if individuals wish to have pets then they should be responsible fortheir actions. Cats in particular are able to kill various native species
1	if its fair on both cats and birds then we should tryit
1	if it's harming bird we should contain them as pets only
0	If not indigenous a speces has no place in the wild
2	if runs on the road not ny faukt if it gets bowled over
1	if the cat cant be restricted to an outside area like a yard it will kill endandered birds. endandered birds are more important than a persons pet because they dont have a choice. we do
1	if theyare  family pet. then whydo they need to leave the house?
3	if theyre indoor only then my neighbors cat wont come to visit. sad face
1	if this becomes reality it will help the native fauna.
1	if we do not do this we harm this land. the alternative is to get rid of cats here
0	if you want acat keep inside
4	ike cats . they are nic to touch
0	ilkethe birdies they are pretty and better than cats
4	ilove my cat and she derserves to have time to sleep in my garden. thanks for coming to my ted talk
0	im allergic and cats are not frendly animals.
0	i'm excited of the alice and wonderland exhivition
3	I'm feeling a bit conflicted with this issue. However I do hope something is to be done sooner for the sake of our native birds. and possible extinction.
4	im for freedom and also human are more dangerous to the evironment than animal
2	im not a massive fan of cats.they do what they want when they want.....annoying little buggers
3	im sad for the that is dying
1	imaginehaving kiwi in thebackyard. way betterthan a cat

3	is it cruel to keep cats inside when their natural state is to be outside?
1	is need to protect the native species
2	is ok cats are defending ther salfe
1	Is possibe to keep cats with us like pets into our home and at the same time take care native environment.  Just need a lot responsability about our pets
0	is the right thing to do isnt it
1	it can be safe from other dangerous animals
3	It can create a lot of stress for the animal and the owner. It will also be very difficult to maintain. Deal to the feral cat population and imported vermin â like rats, stoats, and possums â first.
0	it could encourage more native species to come to our towns and cities so everyone can enjoy their presence. plus it was their place first lets give it bcak to the birds
3	it could work but there are some cats that can't be keeped inside because they don't get along with other pets or they hate being inside
2	it does not really appear to affect anything whe you have a animal it just matters how they re breed if they are breed in  bad matter than things could be bad so its just your decision
1	It has been proven how many wild native birds they  kill. We really neeed to prioritize the eradication of wild cats first. People do not realize how many there are in the wild and the destruction they cause.
2	It has not really affected me but I do think that cats should stop killing native life/birdsbut I think that we can think of other ideas/ways to stop cats from killing native life then just making them inside pets only.

1	it is best that we do  this for the environment; however_ i believe that people will find it difficult because cats enjoy their time outdoors and people too get enjoyent from this.
1	it is better for the birds
3	it is better to bell cats to register them and desex them rather than constrain them which goes against their nature
3	It is cruel to force cats to live only indoors
1	it is good idea cause they eat fish and birds.  they can exercise in the house.
1	it is good to see the public making an effort to conserve native wildlife. Protect native birds!!!

3	it is not the fault ofw the cats. make owners more responsible.
3	it is not their natural habbatat
1	it is not too late to safe some species from extinction
3	It is note a animal to be lock in a place. But its a bg problem for birds...
1	It is possible to keep cats indoors at all times but does it benefit the cat's wellbeing
3	it is really bad that tey kill o many birds and i feel bad and sorry about that but atthe same tme i thin it wold not be ho the naturallive f a cat is. a cat lives otdoor natually and he is a hunter. w should find an othr solution.

1	it may be a less happy life for cats but it will save millions of lives
0	it should be now and mantatory to keep cats inside
1	it will be good because of native birds
3	It will be very challenging to manage and is forcing something that isn't natural. Instead we shoul ensure they wear bells so birds are given warning of their approach.
1	it will help protect our native wildlife. alternatively we can make it a legal requirement to put belled collars on all cats
1	it will protect native and endangered species
1	it will save our nativebirds and faunds

0	its a good idea so the native birds are protected
0	its a great idea like dogs they should be supervised in our native forests
0	its a great idea to protect brds
1	its a great ideati save the wild birds but cats need to be free and live peacfullythats why you must put a bell on it.
1	Its a lot easier to adjust human behaviour than replace native bird species
1	It's a possible solution to address owned cats (even if only voluntary it would reduce cats outside). But we have a significant stray problem as well.
1	It's a shame for the cats but our native species need protecting.
1	It's absolutely a good idea, and I'd like to see it. But I'd say I'm only hopeful 'cos cat lovers are such a force, to put it politely. It would be an uphill and battle against a determined, and to honest, emotional coterie - the mad cat people!
4	Its against a cat's nature to live indoors.

0	its better for our endangeredanimals that are prey to cats

3	its good for the birds but the cat needs exercise
1	Its good for the birds but the cats might not get enough of their own excersie. you can put a special bird collar on your cat so the birds can see them and fly away
3	its hard forcats to be inside all the time
0	It's healthier for all. Save the birds.Give your cat a longer live. Be responsible for your pet!
0	its important to protect our native species
1	its important we do what we can
3	It's impossible to stop distracted owners accidentally letting pets out occasionally. Human nature means accidents will happen.

4	its mean to cats its their nature
1	its neccesaryto protect the native species
3	its not a natural state to be kept indoors. There must be better ways to reduce the bird kills...
3	its not fair on the cats
0	its not fair whn ur cats neighbours poo in ur garden. so yes cat should be indoor only pet
3	its not humane to imprison cats
3	its not n there nature to nothunt. THEY will get stressed inside and that may lead to health problems. they need to excercise and be active tohavea healthy mindset. cats could become depressed andobease
4	its not our place to restrict an animal's basic culture.
3	its not suitable for the cats needs. either dont hold a cat or make it wear a bell
3	it's not sustainable. cats are very hardto keep confined
4	its not the cats its us
0	its not ther fault they were born. but theyhave no placehere
4	its notfair on cats my cat hasonlyever come home with  rats and you can siply give them a bell on there coller.

2	just let cats be bro u gay
3	just more red tape and noncence
4	Just put bells on them if you live a bird populated area.
0	keep them from digging out all my vegi plants
3	Keeping all cats indoors seems unfair to some who may wish to explore farther afield. I feel more hopeful that putting collars with bells on indoor/outdoor cats could prevent native bird suffering. I think this is about training owners to be responsible.
1	keeping cats and native wildife safe is a good idea
3	keeping cats as indoor animal is not their natural way of living. they ned to have the opportunity to climbing and running as well as hunting.
3	Keeping cats as indoor pets is an interesting proposal to protect our native wildlife, but I think that as cats are natural roaming animals, they will not have as good a quality of life. It is also hard to confine a cat to a persons backyard, and many people do not have backyards, as they may live in a rural setting with lots of land space.
3	Keeping cats indoors against their will is very stressful for them as they naturally roam large territories.
1	keeping cats mostly indoors will be good for our native animals.
1	keeping native species safe and keeping house pets is a win-win solution
1	Keeping our nativle wildlife safe is important. At the same time we need to mak sure we're dong right by animals already in our families
1	keeping outdoor cats is a risk to nature and to the cat. They were not born as wild animals.
0	keeping them in keeps them safe from cars and from each other
1	Keeping them indoors at night would be already a great achievement. Most people don't care though and let them wonder at night.
0	Keeping them indoors will help protect native wildlife
4	Keepng cats inside is not appropriate for their species as they need to excersize and keep entertained (e.g. by seeing and smelling things in nature)
0	kei haere au me akau hoa no kapti
0	kitties should stay inside to protect them from dogs and cars and to protect native species!

0	less cats more native birds. put responsibility on owners of cats
0	less danger for bird and lizzards
4	let em go. birds shouldfly. keep thedugs in. woof woof woof woof.
0	letting cats roam freely puts not only them at risk but also places a huge stress on our endangered wildlife!
4	like Australia did there is too much species imported that are invasive. Humans  and there will of controling natureand regulate species are the real threat.
4	like cats so they should be wild
3	like mostanimals i think cats need to go outdoors but weneed a wayto stop themkillig birds.bells and other strategies and limit ownership to one per house. my cat is also a rat catcher and would stopping them going outside affect rat numbers
2	lke a lt of fish by human. a lot of sharks byhuman .who worry about?
1	looking  after our environment and native species has to be our main priority. keeping cats indoors is beneficial to both sides of the debate
3	lots of people will not understand the importance of this and it could divide communities

0	maybe i wont see them anymore.
1	maybe it needs to be compulsory for cats to wear a bell collar. best of both?
1	maybe it will work but its hard to make a decision. everyone love animals and the human is more together with cats thanthe others. humans are egoistic

3	might as well have no cats as pet at all
0	mindful control benefits the animal world
4	mira  la cncha d tu madre el gato es una pija
0	more people should have ragdoll cats that are an indoor breed
3	Most cats are not by their nature "indoor cats". The idea of forcing them to stay inside is concerning from an animal welfare perspective. If it was established that this would not cause them harm or be against their nature, then my current position could change. It also isn't clear what the scale of this problem is - 1mil is a large number, but it could be a small percentage of bird deaths or of all birds, equally it could be very high. Are there other options which could be effective eg desexing schemes?Would be interested in any health and waste issues associated with kitty litter.
3	mr m####### is cute but he kills birds. he loves the outdoors so i feel sad that he does it. i dobt think we could keep him inside because he is an escape artist. to my knowledge he hasnt killed any native birds :/

3	my cat would hate that. just use bells and collars
3	My cat's a bloodthirsty hunter. Sticking a bell on her makes no difference. But she LOVES being outside! I'd hate to trap her indoors. And litter trays... ugh. Then again, maybe we just have to get used to the idea.
3	my cats are assholes i dont want to live ith them
1	my cats are happy indoor only

1	NATIVE WILDLIFE NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED FROM CATS
0	Natives need to be protected as they dont exist anywhere else. We need to be part of our ecosystems.
0	natives were here first .  also cats get their wayon everything; time they heard te word no'
3	natural instinct to hunt  out doors
1	need to protect what is ours and that is our new zealand wildlife.
1	new zealand wildlife is beng compromised. let the birds fly my dude. cats suck anyway.
3	no animal is designed to be totally cative
3	no animal should be confined to an indoor space
4	no animal should be held captive for the  pleasure of humans
4	No animals should ever have their freedom stripped from them because of something they do naturally. Humans kill all kinds of things, why dont we stay locked up inside?
4	no cats at ll or dogs or  preditors
4	no environmental enrichment for indoor cats
0	no natural predators and even the well fed cats hunt and kill native birds
0	no need for cats. it is a privlege to live in an area with with high levels of endism. sacrifice should be no pet cats.
0	non natural animals need to be eliminated
0	Not everyone likes cat especially they poo wee and killed birds and leave at your garden or front yard..! As this survey says they kill native birds which are precious to NZ so I personally think they should be kept inside!
3	not keen on rules being put on owning a cat. thats just stupid. By the way. IMA GENIUS
1	not possible to keep all cats inside
1	ntther place outdor if it is to detroy wild life hope peoplecan understand that
1	nz tries their best to let their biodiversity recover
4	NZs wildlife needs a safer environment
3	on the one hand i want to help restore the original species and save them from extinction but on the other hand cats are free animals too. mine couldnt survive without some outdoor action... how about cats only in cities and not in natural or rural areas? natural reserves?
3	Only because cats could have urges to explore. As long as this could be dealt with in the best intrests of both parties.
1	only if they have access to an outdor area like the catio terry andsue built for their babies
1	or is it evolutionary. maybe we could become the land of cats! contraversial.
4	other controls need to be identified before we simply cage them inside. if you are wrried about it help keep population numbers under control. dont punish the animals for human irresponsibility
0	Our birds, bats and ghekos would benefit from this.
1	our cats already live only indoors
0	our cats are indoor only and do well plus they are safer

3	OUTDOOR AREA WITHA GATE. CATS ARE ANIMALS TOO AND DESERVE TO BE OUTSIDE AS THEY WISH
1	outdoor cats are a major threat to native birds
1	Over 1 million birds are killed each year due to wild cats. By eligically making cats only indoor animals tis will minimise the critical risk of the extinction of birds in NZ.
1	Over a long time frame make cats indoor only.
0	owners can be more responsible with cats and dogs  need to contol their eating and hunting  keep pets under leash or indoors

1	people haveto start to care more about the environment then about thir personal feeling towards their cats.
4	PEOPLE KILL MORE. MAKE THEM INDOOR TOO!
1	People love their cats and they are part of the human ecosystem - keeping them in at night is a great way to reduce the death of birds from cat predation. I'd hope that a balance can be found.
1	people should beresponsible for their pets
4	peoplewh are anti cat are commnist
1	Personally not keen on keeping a cat indoors (not great for the cat - better not to own one), but if it's that or the birds, I vote for the birds. Are bells just a waste of time then? I'm hopeful that the conversation is happening.
0	pet owners cant be responcible for their pets if they alow them to roam free.
1	pets are great but owners should take responsibility for them. cant do that if theyre roaming around unsupervised
1	pets of sorts kinds need licence. feral cats are bsd news. with a licencce comes control over breeding which leads to controls on the release of feral cats inti the environment
1	plenty of safer technologies yetto become mainstream
3	poor kittens jst want to play
1	Possible  goal... but  difficult to achieve...
2	possums rats and so on kill the birds anyway. we should focus gettingrid of thesepredators first who kill like 25 times more native birds every year. indoor cats only is a good way but doesnt solve thprobllem at al. we should put more effot in getting rid of possums rats and mice

1	that cats should stay indoors uless highly trined not tokill i hope that the catscan explore like normal animals
1	that cats should stop killing birds but then i think that the owners of cats ( i am not  a owner but meg and  maisie are) would like to take there cats  outside. like some cats are good!
3	that if cats are constantly killing birds  the nativebirds can be in a lot of danger.oe way to  tryad avoid this problem is that we couldtry and eep the cats indoors or before we let them out we could  make sue that they have pleanty to eat sothat  they wont be killing the birds
4	that it isnt fair to the cat.  there are other methods to protect birds including makibg the backyard fencing so the cats cant climb them.  there are other ways andthoseshould be look at before such an extreeme action which can infinge on the helth of cats.  look for ways that su

0	the cats must go to save the birds. Sterilize the cats  .
1	the cats should stay inside like my cat he is afraid to go out side but to pretect the birds !!!!!!
1	The council of my hometown in Melbourne, Australia has a regulation that cats must be kept indoors at night-time. I think this is a good way to approach this issue. Cats are most active and have the most drive to hunt at dusk and at night-time, so by keeping cats indoors when they have their strongest hunting instincts, they are unable to do harm to the native fauna. I think lots of cat owners like to have some freedom of how they care for their pet, so I think this is a good balance between choice as well as taking care of our native bird populations.
0	the environment needs to be protected
1	The impact of cats on groud-living birds is imense.
2	The issue is largely due to wild cats as well as domestic, we should take further action to eradicate the wild cat pest population.
1	the large numbers of cats damage bird populations. they should be treated as dogs  taken to walks on leads
0	the native birds of New Zealand need protecting. So many have already been hunted to extinction. The world will be poorer long term if these precious creatures arenot protected as they should be
1	the native birds ought to be our primary concern - there arent many left. Plus cats suck in any case.
1	the native fauna should be a priority and responsible/accountable pet ownership be the norm
3	the number of cats in new zealand should be tackled before tackling a house cats way of life and its freedom. regulation as opposed to forcing people to keep cats under constant house arrest
0	the number of nz native birds that have become extinct is shocking. heart breaking. never can we hear thier song. never can we observe their nature. i think of all the birds ive been over the moon to hear on bush waks and tramps...i want the coming generations to share in my joy.
0	the piroritisation of native flora and fauna is extremely important. even over house pets
0	the producers of cat food would appreciate the increased sales Also feral cats transmit diseases
1	them a i have grown up with cats and dogs we had 6 cats at one point my cats would always try kill birds baby birds being the most common victim they kill them slowly i have tried to stop them every time they did i gave them a smack but it never worked its just in their nature

4	They are hunters and gatherers just like us and confining them more in our environment will only cause them to be more reliant on us.
0	they are hunters of our   lovelybird life
0	they are killing far too many birds
0	they are murderous little thibgs and it stops them squabbling with each other
4	they are my family and are acting naturally. humans are the biggest pests to nature not animals
0	they are natural hunters and are a danger to any insect lzard and bird
3	they are not indoor animals and should be allowed to live in the wild as well
4	they are not meant to be indoors animals. then we sould reduce future cat population by steilizing new cats. our dispense permits for cat owners to increase awereness.

4	they needto be in the nature
1	they overbreed and carry bugs. theyre scary but can br useful indoors to deal with rodents as pets. dogs arent allowed to roam and neither should cats
0	they re natual and efficient hunters  so need to be kept indoors to protect endemic wildlife
1	they roam at night and their owners dont know what they are dsstroying
4	they shold be able to go anywhere
3	they shoud be kept in over niht
4	they should be allowed to be free
4	they should be allowed to hunt as the apex predator they are
4	They should be allowed to roam free and hunt without interferenc from humans. We domesticted them in the first plac and it would be unfair to punish them for it
3	they should be free to kill whatever they want no cap

1	thibk they will hen live longr sfer lives nd getheas of love but they also are made tolayin trees etc so kibd of mean of us to stop them from having freedom
1	Think it is a great idea, however think first of all the population of cats need to be looked at. As a lot of irresponsible pet owners are not de-sexing their animals, this leads to cats being abandoned/wild, How can we keep this animals indoors . Also, I am not sure how keeping cats indoors will be able to be enforced with the irresponsible pet owners
3	Thinkits a hard to inforce such a ruleon a population
1	this is a good idea as this helps the population of birds. i have seen the effects of introductry animals and how it has damaged the bird popultion in rotorua
1	this is a necessary policy alongside complulsary sterilisation program
3	this is a tricky situation as cats need a good balance of both life in and outdoors.  if the birds are free why cant the cats be.
3	this is against their nature to scavenge. might  evolve different behavior
1	this is going to take a seismic change in thinking and behaviour
4	this is stupid. makig thisa legal requirement woldnt help. catswiuld get out. it makes more sense tgat cats sould b required to wear bells or something like that.    also this needs autocorrect
0	this is the right thing to do
3	this might be a bad thing to do cause cats need to live and be free with mother nature not stuck up at home
0	this protects cats and native species both!
3	This will be a tough ask of owners. I also feel for the cats. I think it would be better not to own one than to imprison it inside where it can't express its natural behaviour fully.
1	This would reduce indigenous birds fatalities, and I'm hopeful it would also help to establish a culture of responsible pet ownership that would bleed into other outcomes, such as an increase in pet neutering.
3	TNR campaigns should be prioritised for the feral cat population and pet owners have to be responsible by neutering and sterilizing their cats and dogs. Its the only cruel free longterm solution.
4	to force animals into human chosen environments and deny their natural behaviour is unethical
0	to help save our wild life

1	too many birds are being lost
0	too many cats. need to get rid of them
1	Too many native bird species are in danger and need to be protected. Hopefully by keeping cats indoors species will recover
0	too many owners dont thnkit matters that mllions of birds and tiny mammals are being exterminated by their little darlings
1	too many wild animals endagered due to domesticated animals and humans. the wild animals were here first and mankind needs to rmemberthis and RESPECT MOTHER NATURE.
0	totaly agree. all other pets are kept indoors so why not cats? when done from young age they are used to it.

1	tricky, i think more widespread education about how important our manu mÄori are. encouraging cat owners to keep them inside, wear bells and/or be speyed. instilling a culture of consideration and care for a diversity of species.
3	u should throw it back for me

4	very bad they shouldbe in thewid
0	Wandering cats are a pest and predate on birds, especially native species.
1	way forward to address the probem
1	we  brought animals to this country to have  company. it would be hard to forbid them but they should not harm the existence of other animals living here for such a long time.still it is not ok to hold an animal in cavity but  humans are weak concerning restrictions of their life
1	We are long overdue for containing the harm they present to native species. I love the critters but indoors only.
0	we brought cats here and its effecting some of the most uniqe secies in the world. we mst do what we can to protect them
1	we can change our habit of letting cata roam free
1	we can have both but we need to manage our cats better
1	We cannot continue to let the cats kill native birds - there are not enough native birds to sustain this level of killing. The native birds are for everyone and critical to the ecosystem of the land and therefore should take priority.
1	We could lead the world in ecological restoration in the heart of our cities and allow manu to thrive
0	we do not need to own pets in the first place
4	we domesticated cats so we must allow them some some freedom
1	we domesticated cats so we should take responsibiity to house them
1	We don't let our dogs roam wild in the night, why do we let out our cats?
4	we don't like cats. They are very annoying
1	we dont like native birds being hurt. but there are a lot of rodents they kill too...
3	We exhange the sake of a species by the suffering of another. We may preserve more diversity (for a small amount of time according to worlds history) but we are not solving the main cause : human interference in natures pathways! Who decides which life is worth to live?
1	we have a responsibility to protct
1	we have a special week at school next week if it doesn't rain
1	we have achance to protect our native fauna. hopefully we can find a harmonious balance between owning pets and looking afterour ecosystem
1	we have indoor cats and as much as we love then we understand the impact they can have on the environment
0	we have to protect native animals at any cost
1	we have to try but can this be done before we loose more wildlife to extinction
1	we just need to prioritise native specis
1	we love cats but they shouldnt be responsible for the extinction of so many birds
4	we made wild animals our pets and then we ridicule them for their natural instinct
1	we need  to be responsible with our pets and how they effect our enviroment
1	we need a solution maybe just less domestic cats and eradicate the feral ones
0	We need to control our introduced pets
1	We need to do our part to protect the dwindling native wildlife. No pet is worth more than that.
0	we need to dothis to save birds

1	We need toprotect our native birds
0	we need toprotect our native species
1	we shoud whach our cats and make sure they stop

0	we should definitely keep cats inside
0	we should focus on nz widlife
0	we should have already done this. keep cats indoors
0	We should increase NZ native bird populations.
3	we should let cats outside becuase its their nature. but they are catching native birds
2	we should let cats rome around whereever they want and feel Free

3	well cats can be kind so we need to take care
3	well if we have to but i feel like we have taken a lot of the wildlife and tamed it hunted it grew it then sold it. we have killed half of the wildlife already. come on we can do better. also... cats rule
3	what quuality of life would the catshave. humansare lazy
4	when i throwit back is it fast enough
4	while cats do have a impact on our native fauna they deserve to be allowed outside just as dogs are. i do agree with keeping cats indoors at nightime
1	While the counter argument could be that outdoor cats have an impact on decreasing the population of rats and mice, they are unable to be contained to specific locations and have a more detrimental impact on our ever decreasing native bird life.
4	who is responsible about this situation??nature is well done and it is an ecological cycle so perhaps one day birds will find a solution to adapt themselves and correct human mistakes Jacques
4	who wil control rats mice and othwer pests
3	who will catch the rats and mice
4	why dont you  say so didnt even notice
4	why should humans have control? Does that mean we should also be indoor cratures?
4	WHY THEY NEED TO GO OUTSIDE!
2	why you give me asky sentence?
0	wild life is more important than human pets
1	wish ths could be the case. but wont happen
2	with  the increasing population of people who dont care.  more people dont care
0	with cats only indoors we will help spark a new wave of feline evolution. the first great cat cities and civilizations will not be far behind. feline liberation now!
3	with the proper care and attntion we can reduce their impact on our natural habitat without keeping them locked away. Humans are the bigger footprint.
3	worried about all the extibct and edangoured species of nz

1	yes because they kill birds and bring then inside to show thier parents
3	you are changing the way nature should be by forcing this on cats
4	you are dening them thier natural instick and keepingthem indoors would dnythem space to roam nd play
3	you cant take awayan animals rights to outside. how would you like it if humns were only allowed inside
4	you do not have to care
3	You should be certified to own a cat and maybe only be allowed to own 1 -2 cats. It'snot the cats fault that they are hereand they are not meant to be indoors
3	you shouldnt keepa et if you only let it inside. Animals are meant to be outside so give them that opportunity
