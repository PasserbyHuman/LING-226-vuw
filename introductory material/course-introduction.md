## Special Topic: Introduction to Computational Linguistics

*This course introduces students to the way language is represented computationally. The course will cover applications such as lexical associations, part of speech tagging, and sentiment analysis. Students will learn how to use the Python programming language, with an emphasis on natural language processing tools. No prior knowledge of programming is assumed.*

Let's unpack what this actually means for the course. The title should give it away, but by studying computational linguistics, we will spend time learning about computer science and liguistics. 

**1. You will learn some computer science (programming/coding)**

Computer Science literacy is essential in order to work in the field of data science, computational linguistics, or natural language processing. Therefore, we will be learning how to use the [Python progamming language](https://www.python.org/). There are a number of other programming languages we *could* use, but in this course we will use Python. If you are familiar with other programming languages such as Java or C, you will likely find Python different (and maybe easier) because Python does not require compilation and is dynamically typed. [This XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/353) emphasises how "simple" Python is when compared to other languages.

In the comic, the floating person says they simply typed `print 'Hello world!'` and was also able to `import antigravity`. The implication is that Python commands are relatively straightforward and transparent (the `print` comment does what it literally says), and that there are a number of existing modules one can use by simply typing `import module` (although the antigravity library sadly isn't real.)

I do not expect you to master Python by the end of this course (and indeed that is probably an unrealistic goal). Instead, we will learn just enough Python so that we can begin to use some of the many amazing tools developed by other people (using Python) to analyse language computationally. 

To learn Python we will exploit the free, online resource offered by Google called Google Colaboratory (Google Colab) which uses custom Jupyter notebooks to run Python. You can think of this as something like "Google docs for programming." Unlike "regular" Python notebooks, Google Colab requires no local installation of any files or Python distributions. This will allow us to focus on the important stuff (i.e., learning Python) and leave some of the more annoying stuff for a later time (e.g., downloading and installing Python distributions, choosing a program to run Python). 

What this means is that you should make a Google account for this class. I would recommend making a new account that you only use for this class - that way everything we do for this class is separated from any of your personal information associated with your private Google account (should you have one). 

**2. You will learn some linguistics.** 

While programming skills are crucial for learning and studying computational linguistics, so is knowledge of language and linguistics. As such, we will also spend some time in this course thinking about different properties of language and how these properties can be represented using computers. In this course we will focus primarily on the ways computers can be programmed to recognise and process language. An important term in this area is Natural Language Processing (NLP) - which is strongly associated with computational linguistics. 

When "doing" NLP, knowledge of language and linguistics is crucial - all of the programming skill in the world does not help if you do not understand the difference between auxiliary and root verbs or if you do not know what a predicate or a noun phrase is. So we need to understand a bit of how language works as well as a bit of how computers process and interpret language. As [this XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/451/) suggests, it's pretty difficult to "pretend" to be a linguist!
