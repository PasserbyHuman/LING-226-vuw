        "# Word Collocations\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most memorable quotes one learns when studying corpus linguistics is by [Firth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rupert_Firth): “you shall know a word by the company it keeps\". This quote embodies the concept of *collocational meaning* — the idea that the true meaning of words is only realised when used in the context of *other* words. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the definition of collocation from Google Dictionary:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://i.imgur.com/hz3L88z.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Note how the linguistic definition is essentially the same thing as the non-linguistic definition, but includes an additional qualification about habitual co-occurence. Collocations are not just words which occurs next to another word, it's a word which occurs next to another word *non-randomly*. \n",
        "\n",
        "How do we know which words occur non-randomly or not? Think of the corpora that you've already seen thus far — large corpora such as Brown (and even larger than that) allow linguists to mine not just frequently occuring single words, but also frequently occuring word pairs, triplets, and so on. Statistical measures of word co-occurence have tremendous potential to provide insight into natural language and are also responsible for the ever-increasing accuracy of automatic NLP algorithms used today. \n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical knowledge of collocations is not just present in corpora, but is also a function of becoming proficienct in a language. This [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_collocations) contains a decent explanation of some collocations in English. Consider this table from the article, which shows how some word pairs seem natural / correct, whereas others do not:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://i.imgur.com/cWE5iO5.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that none of the word combinations in the \"unnatural English\" column are ungrammatical, rather it's just that they seem to be odd combinations particularly when compared to the versions in the \"natural English\" column. Collocations are extracted from large corpora of language and are thought to reflect language use, which is in turn reflected by our interpretation of which of these collocations seems right and which seem odd. \n"

        "## Bigrams \n",
        "\n",
        "As was shown above, collocations are defined at a minimum of two or more co-occuring words. Collocations can stretch beyond two words, to three, four, or more word partners. \n",
        "\n",
        "A related but crucially different term from collocations is the term **bigrams**. In NLP, the term `bigram` means a pair of words, and technically can mean *any pair of adjacent words in a text*. The more general terminology is `n-grams`, where the `n` can stand for any number. So you can have bigrams (two words), trigrams (three words), and so on. You may find that corpus linguists sometimes conflate the terms `collocation` with `ngram`, but what they probably are referring to are unusually frequent ngrams when compared to other ngrams, especially when taking into account individual word frequencies. \n",
        "\n",
        "Simply put, the relationship between collocations and bigrams is that all collocations are bigrams (or, more accurately, n-grams), but not all n-grams are collocations. In order to be upgraded from n-gram to collocation, it must be shown that the n-gram occurs more frequently than would be allowed by chance. \n",
        "\n",
        "So, collocations are defined based on statistical co-occurence frequencies: collocations are thus two words which are more likely to occur with one another when compared to other words, controlled for each word's individual word frequency. NLTK has a neat function which calculates these values for us — `bigrams` and `collocations`. Let's try `bigrams` on some sample text first."

We have thus far dealt with searching and manipulating text based on the orthographic features of words (i.e., their written forms). That means we have remained focused on the forms of the words (i.e., types and tokens). This has given us the ability to measure basic yet important aspects of texts: length, word frequency, and also some considerations about lexical diversity.\n",
