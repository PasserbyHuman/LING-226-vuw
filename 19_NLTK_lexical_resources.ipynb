        "Lexical resources are additional dictionaries or databases which provide specific types of information about words/language. Arguably, any piece of additional information assigned to a word (like part of speech or length of a worst) can be considered a lexical resource. In this section, we turn to resources that can further add to this information for more specific uses. \n",

        "There are also resources which are more...analysis-y. Things like valency ratings (e.g., how positive or negative a word seems) are used for sentiment analysis, as are other \"word rating\" types of resources which gives perceptions of how abstract or concrete a word seems. There are also WordNet synsets, which NLTK covers â€“ these are used to calculate semantic similarity or words with seimilar meanings, and plenty more.   \n",

The most common type of stopword lists include function words (or closed class words), which in English include articles/determiners (e.g., `the`, `a`, `an`, `these`) and other function words like conjunctions, pronouns, etc.. The logic behind doing this is that the main portions of meaning in any one document will be included in content words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) and not function words. Therefore, calculations on a text may be streamlined by removing function words, *or* a researcher may not want the values from function words included in any one analysis (e.g., removing frequency counts of function words from a text's lexical diversity).\n",
